        title: "Act 1: And So, The Book Opens",
        content: `The Tree of Creation has been growing for an unknowable amount of time. It's considered the Library of Babel — stories like Budj Bim*, the Cosmic Hunt*, The Epic of Gilgamesh, The Iliad, the Canterbury Tales, Romeo and Juliet, and The Call of Cthulhu, along with all other stories, are merely  "nodes" of the Tree.<br><br>
(*See Author Notes for more information)<br><br>
Glowing, growing.<br>
Oh so bright the Tree was.<br><br>
Yet now, only one story remains, the first one ever told, its words lost to time, for there was no one left who could tell it. Torn pages of stories were littered around a single girl, Aicā, the pages scattered around the wooden floors of the Tree of Creation, painting it white.<br><br>
Aicā moves to tear the final story, hands shaking as she grips the page.<br><br>
But the page doesn't tear; instead, the ground ruptures, vines tear through the white pages and enrapture Aicā; flowers bloom on them, bog-rosemaries, pink carnations, and arnicas. The rupture continued; a massive arborvitae tree appeared from the ground, reshaping itself into a woman. Leaves of aspen adorned her brilliant white hair.<br><br>
"Crěwrgw̄yn … why are you here … ?" Aicā whispered.<br><br>
"Isn't it obvious? I'm here to stop you." Crěwrgw̄yn responds; the vines loosen as she speaks.<br><br>
"Why… why… wHY!? I should've trapped you there forever… I-I don't want to hurt you." Aicā sobbed.<br><br>
"Haven't you realized!? You've already hurt me more than words can express!"<br><br>
"I…"<br><br>
"You've hurt so many people, and for what genuine reason did you do it!? You never explain these things to me; I despise you because of that."<br><br>
Though Aicā tried to respond, she couldn't bear the weight of the word "despise." Shaking; quivering. Finally, the words came through, "I… I had no other choice… this was the only way to make everyone happy."<br><br>
"Make everyone happy!? How does destroying everything that has ever existed make anyone happy?"<br><br>
"You… you wouldn't get it."<br><br>
"You disgust me."<br><br>
Aicā trembled at the word "disgust," it was an emotion so strong, clouding her head and heart with lament, pain, yet she had to fight—she had come too far. Standing up, legs trembling, she rebalanced herself.<br><br>
…<br><br>
"Do you have nothing to say for yourself anymore?" Crěwrgw̄yn spat. <br><br>
"No… I don't. I'll do what I think is right, and you won't stop me."<br><br>
The flowers on Crěwrgw̄yn's hair changed to a mix of white lilies and purple violets, before finally turning into a red rose.<br><br>
"Oh, but I will. Well, it was nice knowing you, our time together was… nothing special, so I won't regret this." She said, her roses turning into rues and nightshades.<br><br>
"N-Nothing… special…?"<br><br>
"I should never have trusted you," Crěwrgw̄yn said, as blue tulips surrounded Aicā.<br><br>
…<br><br>
Before the battle truly began, the Tree of Creation created one last book from a blossoming lavender flower, a book that would preserve the story of Aicā, her only love, for eternity. And so, it opened to the first page…<br><br>

The oceans of beginning rippled.<br>
A creature began to form from the ripple. It would be known as "It"<br><br>
Its form endlessly changing, a head appearing where there was none as it moved, a tail disappearing when it swayed. Its power flowed endlessly and never ran dry.<br><br>
There is no origin for "It", for it is the origin itself. Its flow never ceases, nor does it stagnate. <br><br>
"It" was a branching path of nodes; every other "existence" was another component of its being.<br><br>
Whenever "It" touched the surface of the ocean of beginning, numerous new particles began to exist, and the seeds of life flowed from it; creatures began to be born and reborn. The creatures grew into things that looked like dinoflagellates, but were not like dinoflagellates,  like starfish, but were not like starfish, like whales, but were not like whales.<br><br>
The creatures that continued to exist around "It" rapidly changed form, from starfish to whales, sea urchins to arthropods, dinoflagellates to fish, transitioning between everything everywhere all at once.<br><br> They evolved into things unlike themselves.<br><br>
As "It" moves, a head appears where there was never one. It extends its body to the many pasts and the many presents; it determines its own existence, its own future, its own past. It swims through time and swims through creation.<br><br>
As "It" began to exist, so too did "That".<br><br>
"That" emerged in the skies of the end that had existed alongside the oceans of the beginning, and the deep white of everything's end tainted them.<br><br>
"That" was the terminal point, the end of all stories, the point that all creatures drifted to.<br><br>
"That" was simply "there."<br><br>
And then the skies of "That" and oceans of "It" flowed together to form another existence; this other existence would become the goddess of "everything else." She knew her beginning, her ending, she was dreaming of the past, and in the past she was dreaming of the future, and in the future she dreamt of dreaming in the past, she dreamt of the past within the future, the future within the past, if there was a "present" for her, she was the flow of everything, the point where all pasts and all futures could intertwine freely.<br><br>
No two futures were ever the same; every minor fluctuation would guide the future to a wholly unexpected point.<br><br>
She dreamt of waking from a dream, woke from a dream of waking, and dreamt again, waking from a dream again, she saw dreams within dreams, and within those dreams dreamt again, no matter how far you went, each dream was unique, there was no end to this cycle of dreams, this cycle of stories.<br><br>
She saw everything. <br>
She knew everything. <br>
Yet she felt nothing.<br>
But she desired to feel something.<br>
Some future, some past,<br>
Some past, some future—<br><br>

From the depths of the oceans of beginning did the Tree of Creation grow, the trunk bathing in the ocean.<br><br>
And, too, from these same depths, arose spacetime.<br><br>
Spacetime was incomplete without Creation, and Creation was incomplete without Spacetime. They completed each other, they loved each other.<br><br>
Even after they would have to fight, their love would never die.<br><br>
Humans could never hope to comprehend these beings.<br><br>
So they gave them names.<br><br>
"It" and "That" became "Curō" and "Širō."<br><br>
That Goddess of All Else became "Elpīs."<br><br>
And Creation and Spacetime became "Crěwrgw̄yn" and "Aicā."<br><br>

    <h2>Author Notes</h2>
    <p>Budj Bim and the Cosmic Hunt are some of the oldest stories ever. Budj Bim is potentially 37,000 years old, and the Cosmic Hunt is over 15,000 years old. I would also like to mention the Seven Sisters, a story potentially 100,000 years old, though this is contested. I would like to believe it's 100,000 years old, but some have stated that if people looked close enough, they could've seen 7 stars in the Pleiades… but the issue with that reasoning, in my opinion, is that none of these stories of the Seven Sisters shows one sister hiding behind another, but instead that one of the sisters is missing, or dead. I don't know, though, and we probably will never know.</p>
    <p>Anyways, Aicā and Crěwrgw̄yn are most certainly gay for each other.</p>
