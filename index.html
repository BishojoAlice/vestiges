Amid a desolate salt pan, a shimmering golden cathedral stood. Inside it were several pillars, in the middle of them were pearls which glowed an eerie, faint, red, illuminating the otherwise dim cathedral. In the centre, a massive stained-glass illustration of a demon, with red eyes, alongside the demon's other eyes, many hands, and a red robe. His horns were massive as well.

Then, outside the cathedral, a massive red staff with gold accents fell onto the surrounding salt pan. The staff easily destroyed the small planet; while also destroying ten pillars near a door to nowhere.

The world collapsed, and the universe fed into one singular point, a singularity of every single story in existence. From the most well-known, most loved, to the least well-known, forgotten stories made by cavemen in the halcyon days of yore.

* * * * *

A dragon awoke from its slumber on top of a massive lotus flower. Flying up from it into the cosmos, universes flew by it, looking like specks in comparison.

Elsewhere, a tree was being annihilated by the same staff which destroyed the planet. The tree itself was the Tree of Creation, the Tree which holds infinite universes. The Tree's avatars existed within the infinite shore, with infinite trees creating infinite universes forever. However, the infinite shore became finite, as it continued to stand before the sea of Voru beneath it.

The dragon watched as the Tree was being torn to shreds, and its hands appeared from nowhere, in a spiritual state, the dragon stopped the staff, and expelled it, recreating the Tree. Everything restored itself, and the infinite shore became infinite yet again. 

Reality crumbled again, but the dragon denied it. The world was restored, yet… it was also not. Some issues still existed for the dragon to fix.

* * * * *

Back in the salt pan, a woman with a striking black robe with long sleeves, which hid her eyes, on the robe were ears resembling the ears of Anubis. Her robe had gold and purple accents, while she wore a dark purple and black dress beneath her robe, and chains dangling off it. She reached her right hand out to the ground and conjured a magic circle, which had a taijitu in the middle, that was surrounded by the Greek letters "α β γ δ ε ζ," the first six letters of the Greek alphabet.

[As expected…… Wukong destroyed the planet without controlling Ruyi's strength…… I warned him, yet now I must handle the clean-up. The main event lies in the future…… I'll have to deal with this again.]

The woman spoke in a high-pitched voice; as if her speech was coming out of a voice changer.

[Hume levels stable at three…… Narrative Dimension overload fixed back to normal, and the Tree of Creation repaired…… Infinite Shore fixed…… This should mean that I fixed all the damage Wukong caused, whether sent out of time or back in time…… Well…… it's going to happen again in the future…… This is such a headache……]

The woman sighs lightly, her magic circle dimming as well, before vanishing into thin air.

Elsewhere within the salt pan, a strange creature, with tentacles for arms, stood. Its most distinguishable traits were its striking white body, contrasting its black arms. The creature had no facial features and a dark, yet vibrant flame on the right side of its body.

[Ahahaha… a vermin is now on the lands of the King? How impudent. Especially after lord Jeser granted me power…]

The creature spoke, every single word that he spoke oozed arrogance.

[How surprising…… The Psémas remain as arrogant as ever.]

The woman spoke about the creature— the Pséma, whose tendrils unravelled, slashing at the lady, who dodged, as her robe vanished. Her appearance could be mistaken as a bisque doll, her wavy silver hair glimmered in the salt pan that surrounded her. Her outfit was red, and form-fitting, with gold accents, it appeared to be a traditional Chinese or Japanese outfit. The colour of her eyes was a light blue, and on her face, she had a white opera mask on, its intricate designs contrasted the plain colours it had, while multiple feathers were on its right side. She had multiple pouches on her outfit as well.

[Well~~ if you want a fight, I can give that to you~~ just be prepared to lose~~]

[Me? Lose? Do you think I'd ever lose to a fool such as you? You're a clown, you know that?]

[A clown~~? Maybe I am~~ well, if I'm a clown, what are you? The entire circus?]

[Tch. Insolent girl, you should not speak like that to someone stronger.]

[But~~ you're not really stronger than me, now, are you~~? So why should I respect you~~?]

[Say that when you win.]

[Well~~ I'm ready whenever you are, let's settle this~~]

The woman took out a dagger from one of her pouches, and then, she flung it at the Pséma, who tried to deflect it, but his tendrils were cut off. 

[Annoying rodent. Well, in any case, you're foolish; none of your attacks will ever kill me, I'm immune to everything you're capable of.]

[Ah~~ you're a stupid one, huh~~? Watch me kill you.]

The Pséma was hit with many daggers. The daggers fell from many piano wires; seemingly set up by the woman.

[Fucking clown! You and your little tricks.]

The Pséma tries to dodge the dagger, while many more daggers fly in from all directions. As the Pséma finally touched base with the ground, the woman threw down her dagger.

[What? Accepting your loss?]

[Far from it~~ I'm claiming my victory.]

[Wha-]

In an instant, the Pséma is skewered by many spikes, and large black nails, that coalesced from the shadows of the Pséma and skewered him.`,
          2: `

After the Pséma was killed, the woman looked towards the horizon and spotted a figure, moving, and spying on her. Her robe reappeared, as ten golden daggers flew at the figure in the distance. However, the daggers were merely burned up in the flames covering the right side of the figure's body; much like the Pséma before.

[So you're Jeser huh…… or…… to be more precise…… you're Jeser under a false disguise.]

[I'm surprised, you got that correct.]

Jeser, in their feminine disguise, spoke with two overlapping voices—one male and one female. The male voice dominated as if it was the one taking control over the other voice.

[I am the Queen of Information…… Of course, I did.]

[Queen of Information, you say? How droll. You barely know about yourself and consider yourself the "Queen of Information"?]

[Knowing about…… myself is meaningless…… I have no reason to care. All I need is to know my enemies…… And…… it seems to me that Aiv-Zon's personality…… is rubbing off on you……]

[Wasn't the saying "If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles"?]

[That…… refers only to battle capabilities…… not personal matters like one's past……]

[Fine then, have it your way. A polite conversation isn't what I'm here for. Since you killed my subordinate, I have to fight you.]

[Well…… that's fine, but…… you won't be killing me any time soon.]

[We'll see about that. If you're the so-called "Queen of Information," I doubt you'll show me your true power, will you?]

[Of course not…… It would be foolish……]

[Well, that's fine, I have surprises lined up for you too.]

[Oh? Like……. your regeneration snake four hundred metres southeast…… or your magic-infused air bubbles……?]

[Tch. Well, I have to say, you're good, but you don't seem to know everything I have in store.]
[Not even curious……. how I know? As well, I know more than just that…… You practised throwing a ball…… likely a magic bomb. Its power is insufficient to harm me…… And you have a "Voruteut" as your host body…… perfect for this, isn't it?]

[How… I made sure I had no spectators.]

[As I said…… I am the Queen of Information… There's no way I wouldn't know everything about you]

[W-well then, If you know so much, do you even know my past?]

There was no arrogance in Jeser's voice, only a sombre feeling. They truly desired to know his past, it felt like he had tried over and over, again and again, failing time and time again.

[That is…… not something I am obliged to tell you…… What I will say is that…… do not believe the words of Aiv-Zon as the pure truth…… maybe…… if you are able to change, maybe, just maybe, I will tell you the truth.]

[Fine, I'll believe you. Once I beat you, I'll extract all the information about my past from you.]

[You can try…… But I don't want to reveal too much. So…… Φανερός, Ἀρχάγγελος]

(Author Note: Φανερός, Ἀρχάγγελος is read "Fanerós, Archángelos," which is Ancient Greek for "Manifest, Archangel.")

Then, an angelic being appeared, clad in twenty wings with hundreds of eyes on each of them. A golden glow shone from her body, her skin was pale white, and her eyes were a gleaming golden hue.
Instantly, a bright golden light struck Jeser, as hundreds more appeared, each piercing Jeser's skin.

[Shit. This is not good……]

Jeser was coughing, and wheezing, attempting to regain control of the fight. they could do nothing but watch as more beams of light surrounded him. However, in an instant, the beams were dispelled by an immense red aura.

[Strange Power. Red Aura. Identified Origin. Scarlet Sinner.]

The Archangel lady spoke in an odd, robotic tone. Her voice sent shivers down Jeser's spine, despite being protected from the beams of light, they could do nothing but cower in fear.

Before the Archangel could attack once more, a magic circle surrounded Jeser, still cowering in fear.

[Escape? Interesting Choice. In The End, Action, Meaningless.]

As the magic circle grew in intensity, the Archangel readied two glowing spears, and struck the magic circle, destroying it.

[Di-didn't that phantom bubble have several authors in it… and she quite easily shattered the magic circle and the connecting narrative… What is this monster.]

In Jeser's mind, a voice rang out, a deep, cruel voice, full of only hatred.

(Jeser. I do not expect you to survive, I do not expect you to even come back without injury, however, I will tell you about your past if you return with some information.)

Jeser thought for a moment, they needed to know their past, so they had to gain some bit of information.

(My lord, the great Scarlet King, I accept your offer, I shall gather as much information as I can before escaping.)

(Good. I expect your arrival soon.)
[Vasílissa…… Go easy on him. I don't need a child like him dead.]

(A/N: Vasílissa, alternatively, Βασίλισσα, is Greek for "Queen.")

[Processing Request… Understood.]

Jeser stood before Vasílissa, more determined than before. Their body rapidly healed from the prior grievous injuries.

[I may not beat you at full power, but you sure as hell ain't killing me, my Regeneration Snake can bring me back from reality erasure itself! And it's locked behind an infinite barrier, something you can never cross, no matter how strong you are.]

[Foolish, Watch.]

Jeser felt a shiver run down their spine as Vasílissa spoke those words in a cruel, indifferent, inflectionless, intonationless, voice spoke to them. In a flash of light, the snake that was protected by an infinite barrier, and the surrounding salt pan was completely and utterly melted by a single beam. The infinite barrier of Jeser shattered.

[Hahaha… this is some insane power, but, this is also information… valuable information at that. I'll see what more information I can gain here…]
Dark, black, flames run up to Vasílissa and cover her, however, she easily dispels the fire, before pelting Jeser with more beams of light, which they barely dodge.

[I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out here… So… I'll call it quits, I'll hand over the Voruteut body as well.]

[Acknowledged. Under the orders of my queen, I will permit you  to leave.]

Jeser was still shivering, despite her seemingly normal voice, something about her exuded an air of authority. "He has to leave", "He can't continue fighting, or else, he's dead." Those were the thoughts that ran through his head.

In a burst of light, the flames on the Voruteut girl vanished, and presumably, Jeser with it. Vasílissa vanished back into the woman's shadow, which now had glowing golden eyes, always watching.`,
          3: `

[My lord, I have uncovered some major details about the opposing troops.]

Jeser was kneeling before a throne with a demonic creature; clad in a crimson body, and with red eyes, the same as the one from the portrait. It was the Scarlet King.

[Jeser, worry not, I was watching, listening, I saw what happened.]

[I understand. As for information about my past…]

[I see… in that case if you think you are ready to know, and you truly wish to know, I shall grant you your wish.]

[Yes, I am ready for it, my lord.]

The King sighs, pausing for a moment, with an indescribable emotion on his demonic face, before speaking once more. His words were quiet, despite his otherworldly appearance.

[Some long while ago, there was a power-hungry man named Nefel, he was the devil. He may still be around to this day, I know not of his whereabouts, but rumour has it that he is always lurking. For æons, he would hunt for people to gather misery from. Despite not having the power to feed himself from misery, he did so anyway. For this, he would always use his ability to “encompass” anything and everything imaginable.]

Jeser tilted his head in confusion, pondering what it meant to encompass something.

[To explain what may be on your mind at this moment; think of a star.]

The King responded, noticing Jeser’s confusion on the topic.

[Yes, I can.]

[How hot would you say that star is?]

Jeser ponders the question given by the king for a moment.

[One million degrees?]

[Now, with that in mind, listen carefully to what happens when something is encompassed, when he encompasses something, he would become immune to that thing.]

[So, it would be the star in this case?]

[Yes, you are correct. Furthermore, he would perpetually gain a stronger version of that ability. Fathom what that would be like.]

[…Would his powers give him a star that’s two million degrees hot?]

[Far from it, it would be one trillion degrees hot.]

[I see… what a frightening power.]

[With this power, he could also brainwash people, and force them to do his bidding. He would just encompass them, they could no longer fight back against him, and he was a sly one as well. He always wove his words perfectly, every lie he told was believable. He was good at what he did.]

[…And he did all of that to my small town?]

[Yes, it did not take long for him to do so. With his capability to encompass beings, he could encompass anyone; from the lowliest peasant to the greatest nobles, and the king even. And as he did that, he would weave his words to perfection, like he always did.]

Jeser looked mortified, the power owned by this Nefel, and the shattering of minds was all too much to process.

[After conquering the city, he would routinely roam around the village, anyone who dared speak out against him was executed, well, not before being ruthlessly tortured first. During one of those routine checks, he found something that piqued his interest, he found you.]
[He found m-me?]

[Nefel was immediately interested in you, after all, you were powerful, but you also didn’t know what to do with your power. Everything in the world, but a mortal life span like everyone else. So, he chose to teach you]

[And then… he…. taught me?]

[Yes, at first, it was normal, but, as time went on, the assignments he had you do took a massive turn, from something normal, like training your flames to burn some small stuff, to destroying entire opposing villages with just your flames alone.]

[I could do that… as a child? Those villages were probably protected by the gods! I couldn’t do anything like that even now if I tried.]

[Despite his morality, Nefel was a good teacher, he could teach any subject to immense perfection, and make sure that information stuck with you forever.]

[I-I see… so, what next?]

[When he continued teaching you, he noticed something… your morals as a living being stopped you from doing the things he wanted you to. So, he chose a simple option, to rip out your memories, and recreate them with no morals, whatsoever,]

[W-wait, if he ripped out my memories, how do you know, my lord?]

[In truth, I was there as a subordinate of Nefel’s, I truly thought at the time he was righteous, but I was a foolish man back then. As I saw him torturing you, over and over again, I couldn’t stop myself from saving you from his claws when he tore out your memories.]

[I-I truly am grateful for that, my lord.]

[No need, I only did what anyone should have done in that situation.]

In the shadows, some henchmen of the Scarlet King watched, all of their orbs glowed a faint blue. They listened but did not speak. When one whispered, the King ordered their silence.

[Well, continuing where we left off… I had to flee from Nefel, he was far too strong for me to be able to handle in any meaningful manner. As I ran with the memory orb in hand, I tried giving it back to you, but all attempts failed, with nothing better to do, I absorbed it myself like I did my brothers.]

[Your brothers?]

[Ah, forgive me, I got sidetracked. As I was saying, I had no better option than to just absorb your memories, and so, I gained these abilities. And with it, I saw the truly horrifying crimes Nefel had committed against you, and your people, even the crimes he committed before I had joined. Watching the memories was akin to torture. Therefore, I chose to start a journey, to help you regain your morality, to help you learn. And, I think you should know the rest, right Jeser?]

[Yes, I do.]

Jeser walked out of the corridor of the king, and the henchmen loosened up.

[You lot, you’re all dismissed. I shall see you all tomorrow, do not be late.]

[[[[Understood!!!]]]]

The four henchmen spoke in unison and promptly departed, each going their own ways.

[Like I thought… he also failed to ever tell the truth.]

One spoke in the shadows of the night as he exited the building, his eyes hidden behind a blindfold with centipede illustrations upon it, before long, he found himself before another throne, pitch black vines, contrasting with the red and white flowers blooming upon them.

[The great Phantasmal Queen of Space and Time, I have returned, and as you predicted, the Scarlet Sinner never told the truth about the past of Jeser.]

He spoke to his queen, the woman from before. Her robe blended in with the surrounding thorns, and she spoke in the same robotic tone as before.
[Good work…… as always, Montauk.]`,
          4: `

In the massive throne room of the Phantasmal Queen of Space and Time, a subordinate of hers, cloaked in black, was standing before her throne.

[Great Queen of ours, the Koru-teusa have gathered a meeting at the Devourer’s Cathedral.]

[Understood…… send them a message immediately with my acceptance……]

[Yes!]

As the subordinate of the Phantasmal Queen left, she sighed, as she turned off her voice changer.

[I really do have to go back to the place of that devourer again, don’t I~~?]

The Phantasmal Queen removed her robe, putting it near her throne, revealing her dress beneath the robe, a dark purple and black dress with intricate gold accents.

She walked regally outside her door, appearing in the cathedral of the salt pan immediately, its orbs glowing a vibrant blue this time around, the Scarlet King mural on the wall shattered.

There, seven people gathered an angelic woman with pure white hair, with leaves and flowers accentuating the hair. She had 8 wings on her back, and 3 on either side of her head, each a brilliant white with many feathers. Her clothing was a divine white, and red, contrasting her light-blue, almost white eyes. 

Another man stood, his eyes gleaming a dark red, with a luxurious blue kimono, with red accents, with a white haori, while his haneri was also white. His hakama was a mix of white and black stripes, he had on a white, furry, haori himo as well.

Next to him was a woman, with pink hair, in a suit, with a long skirt that flowed to her knees, with red accents on both her skirt and suit. She had a massive red cloak with fur covering her body. Some distance from her was a monkey with a golden headband, a tiger skin jacket, a navy blue shirt, and a small cape. Then was a person, with dark red armour, and what appeared to be 4 eyes across their face. Finally, was a woman in elegant, and divine white and gold garments, she had silver hair and gold eyes.

[Aika! Sup, you finally showed up today.]

The monkey spoke, he was Sun Wukong, the Monkey King.

[I couldn’t help it~~ I had other things to do~~]

The Phantasmal Queen of Space and Time, Aika, responded.

[Ah right, the Scarlet King spreading rumours about me? I take it that’s what you’ve been digging into lately?]

Nefel, the man with the white kimono, spoke next, joking about the rumours spread by the Scarlet King; he was the man from the Scarlet King’s false story.

[Eh?! He was spreading bad rumours about Nefel-san!!]

Said the pink-haired girl, Rakmou-leusan, in response to Nefel’s statement.

[Yeah~~ his rumours have got to the point of brainwashing, from what I can tell, he thinks that Jeser has the potential to beat you~~ So he’s grooming Jeser into being the strongest warrior he has, outshining even his leviathan army.]

[Ahh… he’s really perpetuating such rumours, I didn’t believe he was capable of such things, he’s really thinking he’s able to do anything to us. I’ll crush him, over, and over again, he’ll be nothing but pulp. A beaten mess which is incapable of doing anything. Each of his hands will be turned into lumps of flesh, and whoever chooses to support him along with him. I don’t care friend or foe, if anyone dares stand in my way, I’ll do the same. And if he dares touch anyone else, like Ava-chan, I’ll reduce him to nothing, oh, but he’s already nothing, an ant, a miniscule being compared to use, I’ll be able to do some much-- If he can breathe beyond that, I’d commend him, but with the state he’d likely be in because of it, I could torture him much easier. First I’d take out each of his eyes, of course, being a powerful entity, he can regenerate them. It doesn’t really matter, since I can always do a Prometheus to him, it’s not going to be that hard. But chaining him to a rock and having a vulture eat out his eyes is boring, so, I’ll have to think of better ways. Which I already have, I’ll force him to live through the experiences of all the people he’s slaughtered, from Pangloss, to my dear children, the Humans. I’ll have him see hell, it doesn’t matter if he’s the devil, or whatever, I’ll do the same regardless. Oh, but there’s his subordinates, Moloch, I mean, there’s so much to talk about-- He’s such a fiend, that bull-headed demon. Forcing my children to sacrifice their own children? How despicable. How about I turn him into a child, and then sacrifice him, that’d be fun, surely. And his betrayal? Oh, he’d betray anyone, I may have cast him down to the Darkness Above, but even then, he’s foolish. He truly deserved it. He’s a simple-minded fool who only likes war and destruction. And then the Hanged King-- I’m not sure what I could do that he wouldn’t enjoy, his whole people are sadomasochistic freaks, so little I can do to make it worse. It’d just be best to remove him from this reality before he begins enjoying the torture. Oh, but I can still raze his country of Alagadda to the ground. Other than A’habbat, I’ll have to kill all of his brides, they’re bound to get in the way, though I don’t know if I should tear their limbs off one by one, or gouge out their eyes. Ahh… but then there’s the issue of the Treaty of Thorns and Flesh… Yaldabaoth would likely step in and try to stop me, ahh… but Sofia can deal with her…]

Paradwys spoke next, what she spoke, despite being words, and that could be understood, was near-incomprehensible. Every world she spoke, her eyes turned more and more red, as the red halo-like object on her hair slowly gleamed with arcane red runes.

[Paradwys… first off~~ don’t speak so incomprehensibly, second, we can’t kill the Scarlet King yet, he’s using the power of… Sanna to hide himself.]

[Ava-chan, I fully understand everything you’re getting at, but I don’t care. That fiend must be killed, I don’t care about the veil of Sanna. It’s useless to me, it’s meant to keep some other people out, but I'll break through, eventually. My hatred for him knows no bounds. I’ll shatter that veil of his with my own hands, it’s not something I can’t do. That antithetical storytelling device can do nothing against me. If anything, It’ll strengthen my resolve to torture him, after all, if he can’t die due to it, I’ll be able to torture him as much as I want. Now that you’ve reminded me, oh-- there’s so much I could do, I could torture him for eternity, and he’ll have to bear with it, his worthless veil will be used against him, I’ll have so much fun-- It’s almost insane how much fun I could have--]

[Fine then~~ I’ll have to call off that date you were looking really happy for~~]

[Wai-wai-wait, Ava-chan, you can’t do that!! This is heresy!]

[… Do you even know what heresy means, Paradwys~~?]

[No, I do not, and I don’t personally care, what I call heresy, is heresy.]

[… Are you two seriously arguing about heresy and stuff during an official Koru-teusa meeting———– In other words… you’re talking about personal matters, while we have other matters to deal with, it isn’t acceptable right now.]

In a simple intonation and inflectionless voice, Shiro, the woman with divine white and gold garments, ended the personal conversation between Paradwys and Aika.

**Indeed, to continue, we have the rumours about Nefel spread through the word of the Insect, Harak, son of the Third Brood, and grooming Jeser to be his perfect warrior… How troublesome…**

The armoured figure, All-Death; Ksitigarbha, continued with the prior conversation.

[Yeah~~ really is very troublesome to maintain order and balance without killing the Scarlet King right now~~ which is currently impossible.]

[Ava-chan, Wukong, how about you two journey and meet up with Lùth and Ýli.]

[[Why is it the both of us!?]]

[Well—— neither Ava-chan nor Wukong are technically members of the Koru-teusa, it’s easier this way.]

[Fine~~ I’ll accept then.]

**Well, we must all be off soon, good luck to both of you.**

With that, All-Death left through a small portal, which appeared out of nowhere.

[This was a short meeting, but good luck, Aika-chan, Wukong!]

Paradwys would be next to leave, vanishing in a flash of light.

[Best of luck to you both! See you, さらばだ]

(A/N: さらばだ (Hepburn: Sarabada) means “Farewell.”)

[Ah, Nefel-san, wait, Ai-tan, see you and Wukong-san, later!!]

Both Nefel and Rakmou-leusan got together, with Nefel covering the both of them with his haori, as they vanished afterwards.

[I should warn you, Kuro is not the way she seems right now———– In other words… Kuro may be planning something, not even I can comprehend what it is.]
With those cautionary words, Shiro too left.

[That’s everyone gone I guess~~]

[Yeah, also, do you know why I had to sub in for Kuro?]

[She said she had some important business to finish~~ So, she couldn’t attend the meeting today~~ I’ll bet she’s going to be here next time or something. There’s a lot of chaos~~ and she’s been handling all of that pretty frequently~~]

[And, what about Voru?]

[Ah~~ they’re dealing with all the Voruteuts~~ rumour has it that the Scarlet King took many young men and women. I know he took at least one~~ that being~~ the one who was Jeser’s host body. She’s being taken care of by Vasílissa right now. We’ll have to deal with that as well~~ I bet~~]

[That’s done, roll the afterword.]`,
          5: `

After the Koru-teusa left, both Wukong and Aika talked for a long time, Wukong was sitting on his Somersault cloud, while Aika stood next to it.

[Where are Lùth and Ýli anyway?]

[Somewhere west of here.]

[West!? Not again… I went west enough with Sanzang, and with the cosmic distances, it’s gonna be even further.]

[There are a bunch of rivers and mountains in the way as well. Each with hundreds of demons.]

[WE’RE OUTSIDE THE FUCKING UNIVERSE, HOW ARE THERE RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS!?!?!?!]

[Yeah, so, let’s go.]

[NO!!!]

[Alright, I’ll just teleport us.]

[huh?]

In an instant, both Wukong and Aika appeared before a Welsh-looking palace, it was seemingly made of stone and had many beautiful windows.

[…you could DO THAT!?]

[Yeah, that’s how I came to the Devourer’s planet.]

[Well, I guess, you are the concept of space, after all.]

[Mhm.]

Two people, a man, and a woman seemed to notice Wukong and Aika’s arrival, one had a black, tattered cloak, with gold accents. His face was covered in shadow, and the only visible part of his face was his piercing red eyes. The woman had black hair, and a beautiful black dress to go along with it. She had two flowers on either side of her gleaming black hair, as she too had piercing red eyes.

As Wukong and Aika entered the castle, a butler came and greeted them, before bringing them to a table in what seemed to be a grand living room.

[Ai-san, Sun-kun, welcome!]

The first to speak at this table was the woman, coming down from the stairs, followed by the cloaked man.

[Oi! Bitch! Don’t you dare fucking call me Sun-kun again.]

[Wukong, simmer down.]

[Aika, don’t you dare stop me from teaching this bitch a lesson.]

[Sun-kun, don’t you think you’re too weak to teach me a lesson?]

The woman stared at Wukong, firing several beams of pure energy, and not being damaged by Wukong’s counterattacks by turning into energy.

[They’re tearing this mansion down to the ground again, ain’t they…]

The man in the cloak was watching the fight go down, he spoke in a casual accent, with his worries less on the two fighting, and more on the palace instead.

[Nice complex hax ability you fucking dipshit, now check this out!]

Wukong managed to strike through the woman’s energy form, knocking her down.

[Guh…]

[Never call the Great Sage Equalling Heaven “Sun-kun” again.]

[Okay, Sun-san]

The woman cheekily smiled as she said those words, before vanishing into energy and appearing behind Wukong.

[But… I prefer saying Sun-kun, so I’ll continue with that~~]

[Hey!]

[So… should we just let the two of 'em fight, Aika?]

[At this point… I couldn’t tell you, Ýli.]

[Could ‘ya pretty please go stop ‘em from fightin’ here any more?]

[Fine…]

In a fell swoop, both Wukong and the woman were on the ground, holding their hands on their head.

[Ow ow ow ow ow ow…]

[Ai-san… how rude…]

[If I see any of you two idiots fighting one more time, I’ll ask Kuro to use her punch (strong) on you two.]

[[We sincerely apologise]]

[P-please don’t tell Kuro-sama about this.]

[Y-yeah, what Lùth said, don’t tell Kuro-sama… 
please.]

[Good, now behave.]

[[Yes…]]

“I still don’t forgive you for calling me Sun-kun”

[I can still hear you, you know.]

[Hyiih…]

Wukong recoiled in shock at Aika’s words, before quickly shutting himself up.

[Jeez… do I really need to babysit you two?]

[Mnhh… no…]

Wukong would be first to respond to her question, with Lùth quickly following suit.

[N-no Ai-san, you don’t have to!]

[I feel like I do though.]

[I’m serious Ai-san, we can moderate ourselves, and we will do it from now on.]

[Fine, but if I see you two messing around one more time, I will have to babysit you two.]

Aika sighed and went back to where Ýli was waiting, he was watching the entire thing from the couch, his body still covered in a tattered cloak.

[So, I guess we’re done with ‘em for now.]

[Yeah, we are.]

[Ýli-sama, one of Phantasmal Queen-sama’s subordinates is here. She calls herself Ellie.]

An old butler, though still very fit in appearance, spoke, bowing gracefully before Aika and Ýli.

[Ellie? Why is she here.]

[Apologies, Phantasmal Queen-sama, she will not tell me why.]

[That’s fine, just bring ‘er in, she probably would have something important to say here.]

[Understood, Ýli-sama, I shall bring her in as fast as possible. The rest of you servants set up a comfortable chair for Ellie-sama’s arrival!]

Soon, a woman in a blindfold similar to Montauk, with blonde hair, and an amulet on her chest.

[I apologise for interrupting you two, Phantasmal Queen-sama, and God of Matter-sama, but I have two very important news to share currently.]

She spoke in a very formal manner, and in a very beautiful way too, she was covered in a brown trench coat, and she lightly bowed at the two before taking a seat.

[As for the news… Rakmou-leusan-sama has been severely injured.]`,
		6: `
[Wha… Rakmou-leusan bein’ injured is damn near unheard of.]

[Ýli-sama, I very much do understand your worries, however, those worries are unneeded, as Nefel-sama is currently tending to her, he said that you all should go over there to discuss some stuff.]

[Well… if that's the case… Ellie, you’re dismissed, you should go back to tending to that Voruteut we brought in.]

[Understood, I shall depart immediately!]

[Ýli, Lùth, Wukong, let’s go meet Nefel now.]

[Yeah, yeah, also, could you teleport us… pretty please.]

[Do you think I wouldn't~~?]

[N-no, I just thought you were still mad from the last thing.]

[This and that are different; we’re being serious right now.]

[Alright…]

Aika created a small portal to a beautiful, luscious cherry blossom grove. The sun glimmered through the leaves, and the leaves, and plants let off a faint pink glow. A stone path up towards a Japanese-styled house, as the 4 went up the hill, crossing a small Torii gate, and entering the house not too far away.

[Woehh… this place is as beautiful as always.]

The petals fell on Lùth’s hair, contrasting with her dark black outfit and hair. They continued walking until they reached the front door of the Japanese-style house. As they opened the sliding door, it was Nefel who greeted them.

[Ah, you guys are finally here.]

[Yeah, we’ve heard the general gist of the situation~~]

[Well, as you may have heard, I’ve been tending to her, but, enough of that for now, do any of you want some tea? Or any other drinks]

[Yeah, Nefel-san, tea would be great.]

[Ah, Nefel, if that’s the case, I’ll have some coffee with that.]

[I’m fine with tea.]

[Should this conversation really be that light-hearted~~?]

[Aika, I’m not much older than you, but, I feel like I’ve lived centillions of years more than you have… at this point, having light-hearted conversations is better than worrying over each and every detail.]

[I guess that’s true~~ I’ll have some wine then.]

[Alright, tea for Lùth and Wukong, coffee for Ýli, and wine for Aika, ah, and what type of wine?]

[Red.]

[Red wine, that should be somewhere in the cabinet downstairs, I’ll go get that first.]

[I think Nefel-san is still trying to cope with the serious injuries of Rakmou-san. They’ve never been directly attacked before, and now, this happens…]

[I’m inclined to agree with that~~]

Nefel returned with a bottle of fine wine, and poured it in a wine glass, 
before giving Lùth and Wukong some tea, and Ýli some coffee.

[Well, with our drinks in order… let’s talk about what you guys came here for.]

[Yeah, what happened to Rakmou-leusan?]

[She was heavily harmed when trying to contain a rampaging Al’kawkab.]

[Ehhh? Nefel-san, do I hear that right, that she was harmed trying to contain a rampaging Al’kawkab, one of the concepts of order? Rakmou-san should be completely unharmed. She’s the supreme Concept of Order, after all.]

[That’s what one would be inclined to believe, but, the body of Al’kawkab has been immensely tampered with.]

[And what about Alim, is she okay?]

[I’m not sure… she was remotely piloting her Al’kawkab body, and we haven’t seen her since the body exploded. Well… the body of Al’kawkab is still intact after that.]

[I already have some theories about who’s behind this~~ but, as with any of my theories, I can’t be 100% sure. Anyway, Nefel, could you tell me where Rakhi’s room is?]

[Yeah, it’s right around the corner.]

Aika opened a sliding door, and entered a room with pink accents, with Rakmou-leusan lying down on a futon in the middle. She was unconscious. In her chest was a gaping hole, at least 30 cm in radius. It seemed that Rakmou-leusan was crying; possibly having a dream. In faint words, she spoke.

[I’m sorry… Zeru… but… I can’t join you guys over there… I don’t want to… Eoghan too… I don’t want to… I don’t want to… I’m scared…]

[…]

[Nessa… I'm sorry I forgot you… I should've fought what the entity was that made you be forgotten… I should've been stronger… Yorick… forgive me for… for… not helping you in time… Myron… where are you… Ursula too… I hope… you and… Eoghan have made up… but… why is everyone praising me… please stop… your praises hurt… I… I’m nothing but a liar… I don’t deserve to be next to you…]

Aika just watched calmly, her emotions were indescribable, yet, it seemed as if she was almost about to cry. She hugged the unconscious Rakmou-leusan as if comforting her.

[W-why… I don’t deserve something like this… all of you, you shouldn’t put so much trust in me!! I-I don’t want to betray your expectations again… please…]

As Aika hugged Rakmou-leusan tightly, she was being healed. Aika’s emotions were now sadder, and she seemingly held back tears. She patted Rakmou-leusan’s head, as she was continually crying in her dreams, before falling silent, a smile on her face.

Aika then held Rakmou-leusan’s head in her lap as she seemed to sing a soft lullaby, lulling Rakmou-leusan to sleep. The light shone through the otherwise dim room. Soon, Rakmou-leusan would wake up from her sleep.

[Eh~~ Ai-tan… what are you doing here? And, more importantly… why am I on your lap.]

[I was making your bad dreams go away.]

[Eh? Ah- don’t tell me, you… were reminded of your past as well… I’m sorry about that…]

[It’s not your fault, I was the one opening up my closed wounds.]

[Don’t blame yourself, Ai-tan…]

[Hah… you say that and the only things you say in your dreams are of you blaming yourself…]

[Mnhh… you can’t just make a good argument like that!!]

[Oh, I can’t?]

[Yeah, you can’t!!]

[I see…]

[Ah! Nefel-san is probably worried about me, I have to go back to talk to him soon!]

[Yeah… probably…]

As Rakmou-leusan left the room, Aika stayed behind, instead of a smile that was on her face, she was crying now. She didn’t try to hold back her tears. She just sat there… alone.`,
		7: `
Countless years had passed since Rakmou-leusan first began protecting the current Hytoth from the destruction that the chaotic Voruteuts caused. Her friends and family had long since died, but she always wrote notes; to them. Since the very beginning.

“Mom, dad, it seems our entire Hytoth, the collection of all of the universes that exist, has been destabilised, but I won’t join you guys. I feel like I have a duty to protect the people who are experiencing this destabilisation, if I am strong enough, I’m certain I can protect everyone. I’ve learned some things from Zeru about different terms, I’ll explain them to you after I’ve saved everyone.” — Day 1.

“Dear mom and dad…I don’t know how to say this, even though I put in so much effort, I couldn’t save anyone but my friends. We’re watching the Hytoth crumble around us right now, I don't know if there are any survivors, and I honestly doubt there are. I know I was going to tell you guys about the things that Zeru taught me, but right now, I don't think I can.” — Day 2

"Dear mom and dad, I know it's been a while since I wrote here, but I've been adjusting. There's a new Hytoth now, I'm still not sure who's the one making it, but, I think I met her some time ago. She wore a black dress, and she seemed to be very short, I'd say she was 140 cm at maximum. I only caught glimpses of her though.” — Day 18

"Dear mom and dad, I guess I should explain the things I learned some while ago from Zeru now. Like I said, the Hytoth is the collection of every single universe that has ever existed. Zeru also taught me about narratives, they're basically a single universe, and all of its timelines. Sometimes, a narrative is a multiverse, if all the different universes are interconnected. There's also a hypernarrative, which is a collection of all self-similar narratives, which is basically just a multiverse. As far as we know, the entire Hytoth is made up of these hypernarratives, which, as far as we know, nothing can be bigger than them. I'm not really sure about much more than that, and it's not because I couldn't follow everything he was saying… well… that is true, but still!!” — Day 19

"Dear mom and dad, I'm not sure if I can write everything down as it happens, but, we've at least now transcended, to godhood, it seems our body leaks blood, which I doubt is good, our deific bodies can't hold our mortal blood. Ursula said that we may need some people doing blood sacrifices to help us live… I don't really like the prospect of that. I've never liked blood sacrifices, and the reasons people do it still elude me, but if it's necessary, We'll probably have to do it.” — Day 20

"Dear mom and dad, I guess I forgot to explain transcendence, like with the whole narrative concepts, Zeru was the one who discovered it, I mean, he's the smartest of us. He found some rituals somewhere which could turn us into gods, and we all made an oath to protect the new Hytoth together. I'm not sure what the Concepts think of us, but, they rarely have interacted, some of us are even beginning to despise them for not helping people. I'm sure they have their reasons, but, for now, we have to fight alone. We'll be bringing guidance to those who need it in this new universe.” — Day 21

"Well, both Zeru, and Ursula, both of them did something amazing. I couldn't believe my eyes when they did it. Zeru used his right arm as a weapon, since he can't use his left hand, but, you guys know that… Well, his left arm draws in from the energy of the entire cosmos, outshining trillions of stars, and Ursula ripped two swords from the fabric of reality itself. I'm not entirely sure how she did it, but she says that the weapons exist within the entire existential plane itself. Though, I'm not exactly sure what that means, entirely.” — Day 22

"Dear mom and dad, it seems Eoghan has withdrawn himself from the group, he never forged new weapons once ascending, like Zeru and Ursula. He's simply improving the weapons that he already had. I'm not sure how long he'll take, I don't think we'll have anything of note happening for the next thousand years, so I'm not sure if I can write every day to you guys.” — Day 23

"Dear mom and dad, I'm not certain how long it's been since I started doing these, so I'm not going to add dates, since the destruction of the Hytoth seems so very… distant. This Hytoth is growing to be large, and beautiful. We see the Concepts every now and then, and apparently, there's another group, albeit they're made of concepts, very much like us. Apparently, they're the "pillars” of order, a group of deities whose families chose to bear the title of "Concepts of Order.” They go around to every single universe, making sure nothing is being corrupted, nothing being destroyed. They work much harder than us, I believe, even though Zeru reassures us that we're all working really hard. It's nice though, to have a group of people who are doing the things we're incapable of.”

"Dear mom and dad, Eoghan has finally returned, he's built three ascended cannons of metal, and dark matter. With us all gathered together, we tested the cannon in an empty desolate universe the pillars of order had let us use. The firing of the cannon was brilliant, it rang across the empty universe. It was really, really, loud, I couldn't believe it. Everyone was praising Eoghan, but I felt like Ursula was a bit envious at that moment, I'm not sure though.”
* * * * *
During the many battles that the Koru-teusa faced during their time, it was the first true invasion of the Voruteuts, spearheaded by the mastermind behind it all, Aiv-Zon. During this time, the entirety of the Koru-teusa were overwhelmed, so, in a bid to protect the Hytoth, Zeyu-leusan, known by the Koru-teusa as Zeru, chose to sacrifice himself for the sake of the Hytoth. Gathering up all his energy, and all of his life essence, he put it all in a single holy lance, destroying all of the Voruteuts, but dying in the process.
* * * * *
"Dear mom and dad, I'm sorry… I can't write anything today… I hope Zeru is there with you two.”

"Dear mom and dad, I'm not sure where █████ is… she seems to have vanished. We looked for her many times, but, every time, Ursula, Eoghan, and Yorick would forget about their mission. It was really odd, I hope I can find… I'm not sure why… but I can't remember what I was writing about, my vl5lcn is blvvrlng mom… dad…”

“Dear mom and dad, this is probably the first time I've written one day after the other in succession since I first started writing here… Yesterday, Ursula found me, collapsed in front of this diary, I'm not sure what I was doing, beyond the fact that I was writing to you guys. I'm sure Zeru would've had an explanation for it… I'm… sure…”

"Dear mom and dad, I decided to write this early in the morning, Ursula and Eoghan got into a fight just now. I've been leading the group since the death of Zeru, so I've been mediating our arguments, but I've been having a constant ringing in my head, as if I've forgotten someone, someone… Ne-”

"Dear mom and dad, It seems I collapsed while writing this again. I'm not sure why, but I'll stop dwelling on it. I always end up feeling better afterwards anyway. Well, whatever, Eoghan and Ursula have been fighting a lot more, Ursula is usually the one who starts the fights, and neither me, nor Yorick, know why she’s doing this.”

“Dear mom and dad, apparently Eoghan is renowned across the Hytoth for his cannons, I’m always amazed by his creativity. But, as always, Ursula seemed envious. Maybe it’s because she used to be known by everyone, and loved. I’ll go talk to her about it tomorrow, I want her to feel better, and feel loved.”

“Dear mom… and dad… I was too late… Eoghan and Ursula got in yet another fight, but it was more dangerous this time… and they ended up… they ended up… now me and Yorick are the… only two left. I’m not sure how much I can continue fighting… Our place feels so empty now, with Zeru, Ursula, Eoghan, and now, only me and Yorick are left.”

“Ahh… they’re all gone… I’m the only one left… I… I’m the only…”

This last note was covered in tears, the rest of it was all illegible. Yorun-leusan fell in the year 2000, after the largest wave of Voruteuts in history. Finally, after years of loneliness, all alone in the place she called home. The memories of the others rushed in, all of them, but, now, they were all gone. Rakmou-leusan stopped writing notes after this, not because she didn't care, but because, by herself, she had no time. She wanted to protect the Hytoth, to carry on the wishes of her fallen comrades.`,
		8: `
One day, she finally had free time, after æons of fighting, she was finally able to relax, it was strange. But, finally, she could write to her deceased parents again. But there, inside her house, was a person, clad in black, a veil over their face, sitting in a Japanese seiza. Their appearance resembled that of a kuroko, Japanese stagehands for traditional Japanese theatre. 

Rakmou-leusan, not expecting someone, grabbed her spears, which folded into swords, before she could attack the person, he stopped her.

[Please, Rakmou-leusan-sama, we are not here to harm you. We are the kuroko, stagehands for the Phantasmal Queen-sama. I'm here to send you a message, I'll read it out for you: “You, and the rest of the Koru-teusa, Zeru, Ursula, Eoghan, Nessa, Yorick, and Myron—”]

[Wait! Who are Nessa and Myron!?]

[I'm sure it'll be explained to you, there are likely forces, which I do not have the authorization to tell you of. Now please, let me continue, "You have battled for a long time, I'm sure you're curious, why did we not fight Aiv-Zon as well… We could beat him soon, but it appears someone who we don't want to lose is on his side. However, if you meet us at the sanctuary in the centre of the Hytoth, we will grant you your ability to become a concept. This may surprise you, but we shall explain everything there.” That's that it says]

[W-what… so… I'm a concept?]

[It appears so. Now, please, do go to the sanctuary, as our queen wills it. Now, as a kuroko, I have spoken too much, so if you'll excuse me.]

The kuroko of the Phantasmal Queen left the room, and Rakmou-leusan found herself thinking in her room. Finally, closing the door of her room, she left, and headed to the sanctuary. Along the way, she saw Voruteut, after Voruteut, but all of them were stopped by someone else before she could react. Once she reached the sanctuary, she was exhausted from just walking. 

The sanctuary was a small island, it had a massive bridge coming from it, a dark-blue-haired woman, with what seemed to be heterochromia, her left eye was a dark red, and her right a lighter bluish-purple. Her hair was long, and she had bangs, and what appeared to be a bob-cut hairstyle. She wore white garments, which had golden accents. While Rakmou-leusan was admiring the sanctuary, she walked up to her.

[Excuse me, but do you have business in the place of the Concepts?]

[Eh? Uh… well, I was apparently called here.]

[Oh, so you’re Rakmou-leusan-sama, sorry for my rudeness.]

[Hmm? You weren’t rude earlier, also, you don’t need the honorifics, you can just call me “Rakhi.”]

[It would be bad manners of me to not call you, a superior of mine, by your proper title. Therefore, I cannot do that.]

[W-well then… I guess that’s fine… but more importantly, what’s your name?]

[I am Az idő, the supreme deity of time, daughter of the Phantasmal Queen.]

[Ehh? Phantasmal Queen’s daughter?? I didn’t know she had one.]

[Well, I’m not the only one, there’s A sors, supreme deity of destiny and fate, and Az élet, supreme deity of life.]

[Wow… so you’re triplets, or what?]

[A sors is the eldest daughter, Az élet is younger than her, and I am the youngest… but I do apologise, it seems I’ve taken up too much of your time, please proceed to the sanctuary.]
[But you haven’t— oh well, I guess I should get going.]
Az idő stood aside, as Rakmou-leusan headed onto the bridge, and into the sanctuary, it was a flower field, with white and gold flowers.`,
		9: `
In the centre of the island, was a table, with seven seats, a roof was above it. As Rakmou-leusan was admiring the beauty of the place, 6 people came walking to the table. Noticing that Rakmou-leusan was there, they stopped talking, and sat on the chairs, the biggest chair; almost similar to a throne, had no one sitting there.

[Umm… is there supposed to be one more person sitting over there?]

[Hmm……? Oh~~ that seat~~? That’s yours, you know?]

[Eh? Mine? How is it mine? I just got here.]

[We’ll explain later~~ for now, just get seated.]

Begrudgingly, Rakmou-leusan sat down on the large chair, and the group began talking.

[So, to explain, for one, you’re a Voruteut———– in other words, you’re one of the beings you’ve been hunting for so long. But this doesn’t mean you’re inherently evil, not all Voruteuts are evil———– in other words, it’s just a select few Voruteuts that are inherently evil, such as those under Aiv-Zon.]

[Eh? Not only am I a Voruteut, they’re also not inherently evil… I guess Zeru was wrong about that.]

[It’s not his fault that he was. The Voreiks are gashes made by Aiv-Zon that allow them to escape into this reality, no other Voruteuts have ever done such a thing.]

**Indeed, what Nefel says may not be believable at first; but I assure you, it is. The insect is the only one I imagine to do such a thing.**

[Yes, yes, none of my Voruteuts would do such a thing, as far as I can tell, it’s only Aiv-Zon doing such a thing.]

[Wait wait wait, what do you mean your Voruteuts?]

[Ah, apologies, we haven’t even introduced ourselves, I am the Concept of the Void, Voru.]

**And I am the Concept of Death, Ksitigarbha.**

[I’m the Concept of Everything, Nefel.]

[I’m the Concept of the End, Shiro———– in other words, I’m the incarnation of the very complex end of stories, regardless of what the story is, it will come to a close.]

[Ah, I haven’t talked yet, I’m the Concept of Creation, Paradwys, I’ve been creating the baseline for all universes since forever, I can’t remember a time before my creations existed.]

[That’s because your creations began existing at the same time as you~~ anyways, I’m Aika, the Concept of Spacetime.]

[And I’m Kuro, nice to meet you, I’m the anti-Shiro, the Concept of Beginnings.]

[Wow, that’s a lot of… ridiculous concepts you guys are. Everything, the End, the Beginning, Death… wait, isn't the end and the same as death?]

[Not entirely, I'm the “End of Stories.”———– in other words, I can close the metaphorical book of a person, a concept, a universe, etc., I can even end the concept of death, for example.]

[Eh? I see… right, how exactly am I a Voruteut?]

[You see, during the era of the First Hytoth, the void Voru was far more volatile. During this time, we were scared that my dear creations would be destroyed… but it ended up fine, the volatile leaks were less dangerous than we thought they’d be. So all my dear children were safe. Well, one of them occurred just as you were being born, altering your genetics slightly, but enough to make you a Voruteut. So, since you’re a Voruteut, you're closer than most deities to being crowned as a Concept, once you've met our criteria, at least.]

[I see… but… my main question right now is… why do I get the fancy chair.]

**It was decided when we were walking together, as you have experience leading a group. We’ve been observing your actions since you first ascended.**

[You’re also probably confused about who Nessa and Myron were in Aika’s original letter, I reckon Aika has something to say about Nessa and Myron though.]

[Nefel… well, I do have something to say about Nessa, but as for Myron, it was out of my control.]

[Eh? What do you mean by that?]

[So, some while ago~~ I had created a “program,” for lack of a better word. It was mainly a test, to see how inhabitants of the new Hytoth reacted to higher-dimensional entities~~ regardless of if they were good or not. They were placed as “constants,” entities who existed all across a singular hypernarrative. The Constant of Chaos~~ and Creativity, was one of them, it was named “వ.” One of its avatars was a rogue memory vore, which would go around consuming memories. It must have encountered Nessa at some point, given they both had a connection to 5, it was inevitable that such a thing would happen.]

[Eh? The number 5? What does that have to do with anything.]

[Nessa was the Holy Fifth~~ వ was an entity inherently linked to the number “5.” Given that you’re a member of the Koru-teusa, you may have been told about the Fifthist Churches across several narratives, these churches worshipped వ~~ due to his connection to the number 5, they all named the churches after the number. As well~~ entities correlated to numbers seem to be “attracted” to each other~~ 5s are attracted to 5s, 6s to 6s, et cetera.]

[I see, so Nessa was attracted to this వ, and then it consumed people’s memories of her… how horrifying.]

[As for Myron~~ he was the Holy Seventh, and, even since the beginning of the first Hytoth~~ there was an entity~~ a narremevore~~ correlated with the number 7. I’ll assume this is the first time you’ve heard of a narremevore. In a nutshell~~ a narremevore is an entity~~ or a program~~ which goes around consuming universes it finds tasty. The narremevore in question is likely Itheadair. Of the narremevores, it’s the most dangerous, and most like a program~~ so~~ it destroying Myron by accident is extremely likely.]

[I see… and we just lost all memory of it?]

[Yeah~~ you guys did. However~~ now that you can become a concept~~ you should be able to regain those memories.]

[Yes, yes, right, like Ava-chan said, once you become a concept, you regain those memories… however, becoming a concept… well we haven’t yet decided which concept you should be… so…]

[I was thinking Concept of “Order,” as the potential concept for her.]

[Nefel… that’s a… strange idea, aren’t there already so many Concepts of Order?———– In other words, we have 7 Concepts of Order already, why should we need one more?]

[Well, my reasoning was that the current 7 Concepts of Order are in dire need of organisation, and we can't be keeping them organised all the time, we have other things to deal with, namely with the narremevore. So, I'd say Rakmou-leusan here can help us with that, I mean, her whole thing is making sure the Voruteuts of Aiv-Zon don't cause chaos.]

[I see… that's certainly a good point———– in other words, I see where you're coming from, it's definitely a good decision to have her, given how much she knows about fighting chaos. Also, Kuro, you've been awfully quiet this time around———– in other words, I'm surprised you're not saying more, especially since Rakmou-leusan will be joining us.]

[Ehehe… well, you see, I'm not entirely sure on how to add onto this conversation… you guys are handling it really well, so I can't really do much here.]

[Well then, Aika, didn't you have some words to end this off?]

[Hmm? Nefel what're you~~ oh~~ yeah~~ those. Now then, Rakmou-leusan, or should I call you Rakhi? I'm sure either is fine for you, but, whatever. Rakhi, you know how you constantly saw Voruteuts attacking, and getting stopped by other people?]

[Well… yeah, I guess I did?]

[I planned that path you took so that you can see that you're not alone in fighting for order, and the safety of the Hytoth. There will always be more protectors to help you, if you need their help. I do wish that, no matter what, you do not become disillusioned with the path you, and your comrades have chosen to take, and you keep fighting, because there are others like you, who need you, and, more importantly, have looked up to you. Now then, with that, I bid adieu to you.]`,

		10:   
`Rakmou-leusan found herself back in the home, but, now, she didn't feel it empty, she felt it to be fuller than ever. Especially knowing that the path she had stuck with had truly made a change in the Hytoth. More and more protectors like her would appear, and she was the reason why. The dangerous path they took was being illuminated by her presence.

“Dear mom and dad, I finally met some of the Concepts, they're an odd bunch, to say the least, but not in a bad way. They all have their strengths, and they're all fun to be around. I guess I'm now one of them, I'm still not sure how to process the fact that I'm now a Concept. Oh, and I said I'd be explaining some terms to you, and I guess I'll finish up on those. Aika was the one who taught me this, this time. She's really kind, she brightened up my day… Well, according to her, the Hytoth is made up of Phantom Bubbles, something so inconceivably large that we can't even notice they exist. It's weird how they work. In a nutshell, Phantom Bubbles are made up of countless hypernarratives, and contain the world-view of an Author. These world-views are a tough concept to grasp, and I had difficulty as well, so I'm not the best person to be teaching these, I guess… well, Aika did tell me to contact her if I needed more information on them… so, I guess I'll talk to her by pigeon, which all concepts use to communicate, apparently they're really fast. I'll write down everything Aika tells me later.”

"Well, I was thinking it'd take a couple hours, but no, it took less than 10 minutes. Well, here's everything Aika wrote there 'There's a lot of concepts to go over, so I doubt I can give you a run down on everything but these are probably the most important.

Unreality/Hyperreality: I'll be best off explaining this using an example.

Universe β is fictional to Universe α

By this logic, Universe β is more unreal, compared to Universe α

Universe γ is fictional to Universe β

Therefore, Universe γ is more unreal than both Universe β and Universe α, thus making it the most unreal. Thus, α is the most hyperreal.

The Tree of Creation: The Tree of Creation is the tree sprouted when Paradwys was first born, it's complex structure of nodes, that extend from the most unreal universes, in comparison to every other universe, and the most hyperreal. The Tree itself is not the Hytoth, the Tree and the Shore are.

The Infinite Shore: This is the shore before the chaotic Voru, it houses infinite universes, contains the avatars of the Tree, these Avatars exist as different creator deities, like say, Chaos from the Greek stories.

Voru: The chaotic sea of nothingness, much larger than the Hytoth, and by a wide margin. Everything that happens in this void is chaotic and unpredictable. The word "void” was only used to describe it, since it consumed the previous void which permeated existence, Shinkū.

Hume: A Hume is a measure of how real an area is, reality benders influence their surroundings by having a higher Hume level than it, by lowering the Hume of said surroundings, or both. High Hume levels means the place is more real than most other places near it. Low Hume levels means it’s less real. They sort of work like reality/unreality, but for things within a local universe, not the universe itself. The sum total of all the Humes in a universe must equal 0.

Narratives and hypernarratives: These are stories, typically, 
narratives are just one universe. However, narrative dimensions are countless universes, in a filament-like pattern, think of galactic filaments, and hypernarratives are countless of these narrative dimensions stacked on top of each other. Authors exist inside higher narrative dimensions than their creations, but are part of the same bubble of reality, this is a phantom bubble.

Voruteut: I feel like you should know about them, but, I’ll explain what they are. Voruteuts are “beings of Voru,” as that’s what their name would translate, roughly, to. Voruteuts are beings which formed inside of Voru, despite the void ripping apart everything else that exists within it, Voruteuts are able to survive.’

And, that was all she said… yeah that was definitely very long, but, she had to explain everything she could, very concisely, so I’m thankful for that. Mom, dad, I hope you’re doing great up there, because I’ll continue to fight down here, for everyone who’s believing in me.”
* * * * *
The sanctuary is quiet now, Aika is the only one there, sipping some tea. On the bridge leading out of the sanctuary, is Kuro.

[Kuro~~ what are you doing here?]

[Well, I had some problems with the things you said, or maybe it was just me not understanding.]

[Why not use the Eyes Who See Truth?]

[That seems… like cheating… I want to hear it from you, directly.]

[I guess it’s about Rakmou-leusan~~ isn’t it?]

[Yeah, you told her that there are more like her, protectors, who strive to protect the Hytoth. How did you get all of them to be on the path you planned out? If they’re truly protectors, they’d be all across the Hytoth, but why were they in a single path leading to the sanctuary?]

[Kuro, you seem to be misunderstanding something… they’re not the only protectors who are in the Hytoth… And if you’re wondering about the timing, well, it’s simple really, the Voruteuts of Aiv-Zon usually attack all locations at the same time~~ you know~~ from chaos comes order? That kind of thing.]

[Ehehehehe… I guess I simply forgot, sorry about that. But, like, if all the Voruteuts attacked at the same time, what about the place where Rakmou-chan defended?]

[Hmm? I sent someone very special there~~ He was protecting the that location in place of Rakmou-leusan.]

[Hold on, you don’t mean you sent…]
* * * * *
On the rooftop of the house of Rakmou-leusan, sat a man. His hair flowed in a breeze that should not exist. Beside him, was a massive white lance, as he was staring at his right arm, closing and opening it, as if he hadn’t had a right arm for a long, long time. A smirk ran across his face, as he looked up at the infinite Hytoth.

[It seems that she’s doing well… I’m glad I got another opportunity to fight.]

As the man spoke, a rogue Voruteut appeared, but, using his holy lance, he destroyed it.

[Looks like I’m definitely not getting rusty any time soon, well, 
I guess I’ll have to leave. I hope she didn’t notice I was here.]

Saying those words, the man vanished into thin air, as if he was a ghost.`,

      11: `
Aika wiped off her tears soon enough, although she still had some tears falling. She sat in silence for a while, before standing up and heading out the door, remaining in silence; a stark contrast to the cheerful conversation in the background as she went and sat down on the tatami mat on the floor.

[Ai-tan, let me remind you again, you are not the one at fault for Eris-chan's death. Hell, you could blame everyone else here, except you.]

[Hey—! I wasn’t even born then! I was just a stone, not a stone monkey!]
Rakmou-leusan lightly laughed at Wukong’s comment, before continuing.

[I stand corrected; almost everyone.]

[Aika, like Rakhi-chan said, we’re the main ones at fault. If you keep on blaming yourself, it won’t be good for your mental health.]

[Nefel… you too…]

[I feel like you need to cool off, and have a drink, I got it from Ao Guang.]

[Thanks… Wukong.]

[Well, for now, let’s talk about something else. Aika, are ‘ya fine with that.]

[Yeah… I think instead of being depressed about the past, I should try to fix the present.]

[Woo! That’s the spirit, Aika! Well, it’s not like I know much about your past, I was a rock then, but even still, being frustrated over the past is natural in itself, but getting over it is helpful.]

[…Yeah, well… we’ll have to deal with the now rogue Al’kawkab, right?]

[Ai-tan… I’m not sure who can deal with that, we need you to help find Alim-chan, and none of the other Koru-teusa knows why Al’kawkab is now so strong, so, it’s too dangerous for them…]

[And then, there are the Constants, Lùth has Void Black of Sevens, Ksitigarbha has Life and 
Death, and don’t you have Colourless Green, Aika?]

[…Yeah. Did anything happen to it or something?]

[Well, one of the avatars of Colourless Green was consumed by a child of the Scarlet King]

[Jeez…… which one?]

[Atanti-ql-paneu; the Leviathan.]

[Atanti, huh? Well…… it’s not like I can’t deal with him, but, it’s going to be a pain.]

[Thankfully, it was a weaker Colourless Green, however, it has taken control of at least 
twenty timelines already.]

[It shouldn’t be hard… but there’s always a catch to these kinds of things, isn’t there?]

[Yeah, in all likelihood, Atanti is protected by the essence of Sanna.]

[…]

Aika froze up when she heard the word “Sanna,” her aquamarine eyes flickered a bit before Nefel spoke up again.

[If you don’t want to, it’s fine, you don’t have to.]

[N-no…… I’ll do it……]

[Are you sure?]

[Yes…… I am……]

[Alright then, you can deal with Colourless Green’s situation, and meet back up with us to take Alim back from the prison where me and Ýli deduced he’d be.]

[Got it…]

Aika manifested her robe back on her again, her veil covering her aquamarine eyes yet again before she vanished into a cloud of black smoke.

[Ah, wait—we still needed to get someone who’d fight Al’kawkab.]

[Both Kogane ni somatta shūen and Aoi shi agreed to fight Al’kawkab.]

(A/N: Kogane ni somatta shūen (黄金に染まった終焉) means The Demise Dyed in Gold, while Aoi shi 

(青い死) means “Blue Demise”)

Aika reappeared in a black haze and spoke through what seemed to be a voice changer again.

[Ah, thanks Ai-tan.]

[Oh, and, let me give you the plan……. First of all, Rakhi, it’s best if you stay here…… Nefel, Lùth, and Ýli are going to the prison where Alim is likely to be, though, Ýli might be enough for the prison……. Let's see, Nefel and Lùth, try infiltrating the Scarlet King's palace…… and finally…… Wukong is going to go with Aoi and Kogane.]

[That… Well… I’d like to object to that, but I know I have to remain here regardless…]

[Well, I’ll be off now…… actually this time…….]
* * * * *
Aika vanished in a haze of black smoke yet again, appearing in an ideatic space, a space full of thoughts, dreams, nightmares, memories, reason, and consciousness. It was a space known as the Noösphere, the space of thoughts only.

There were many worms, spiders, and creatures, alongside these ideas, some burrowed holes within the Noösphere, while others tried to grow everywhere, they tried to be known.

Aika walked within this crowd of creatures and ideas, squashing each bug as she went along, repairing the holes that she saw, and some other menial tasks. Then, at the very heart of all of these ideas, was an idea, vaguely reptile-like in appearance, yet also vaguely whale-like in appearance. Unlike the rest of the various creatures within this odd location, it seemed to have something. Within its glimmering blue and gold form, was a semblance of sentience, as it corrupted and altered minds, and spread itself across the Noösphere, it knew what it was doing, and it constantly was relishing in enjoyment.

The reptile looked up and growled at Aika, as it attempted to lunge at her, it was swatted away, like a fly. It bubbled, and growled again, lunging at her yet again. He could never reach Aika, stopping, or, seeming to stop, just short of her. It composed itself again, shaking its head as if it saw something it shouldn’t have.

[Phantom King…… what are you doing here?]

[Wow…… talking after you’ve failed to attack? And……. To answer your question……. I’m here to 
kill you.]

Aika, yet again, spoke in a high-pitched voice, the same one which seemed to be coming from a voice changer.

[Kill… me? Those fools at the Foundation already failed… what better could you do?]

[I mean…… I have all of eternity…… I’ll figure something out eventually.]

[With the power, and veil of Sanna, you’re not going to.]

[We’ll see……]

Aika moved her arm to the right, as various dark spiders appeared from under her robe, and a starfish-like creature with a 5-fold symmetry, and a complex fractal, went off into infinity.

[వ? One of his aspects? Really. I already ate one, you’re giving me another.]

(A/N: వ is the true name of SCP-3125, read: “va” as in the Telugu letter.)

[You ate an incomplete avatar…… not a complete avatar like this.]

As the fractal starfish, వ, rested upon Aika’s arms, it grew in size, becoming the entire Noösphere, both Aika and the reptile were trapped within a small fractal pattern in the form of the starfish.`,
          12:
`Atanti-ql-paneu watched, embedded within the Noösphere as the structure of ideas shifted to fit వ’s ideals. Atanti was then falling, and falling, and falling, he fell for what felt like an eternity. Atanti felt his body rot, and decompose, despite the idea of his body not existing within the Noösphere. It was as if వ had changed the idea that made him up. He adapted, like he always did. As he rose from the black void, he could no longer feel the rot get to him.

He swam up and up, and up, and up, and up, but there was no end, below him was infinite darkness, and above him, was infinite darkness. In this place, beings that did not exist emerged, and those beings screamed, for a place in existence; patterns within the non-existent universe.

After adapting again, and again, and again, he finally resurfaced. He found himself in a small lake, seeing the bodies of what seemed to be researchers, all with patches that said “Secure. Contain. Protect.”

Swimming through the bodies, which seemed to be like apparitions, he finally made landfall, finding a green 5-pointed star, similar in appearance to వ. He tried eating it, gnawing at it like a dog with a new toy. Before long, he was back where he was before, where Aika was still waiting for him.

[You… where was that place?]

[I’m impressed…… you really survived that trial.]

[You didn’t answer my question.]

[Do I really have to?]

[So be it.]

Aika snapped her fingers and Atanti appeared in an entirely different place.

[You seem on edge.]

[Who… are you…]

[Alastair Grey, with an e.]

[…You’re one of those antimemetics, aren’t you?]

[You seem on edge.]

[You’re not sentient… you can’t kill me.]

Atanti adapted, his body resembled a massive computer tower, which towered over Grey.

[Good to meet you, where are you from, if you don’t mind me asking?]

[I come from Megiddo, and I’ll be sending you there.]

[You didn’t answer my question.]

[I did. You’re just incapable of understanding my speech.]

Atanti rammed his computer-like body into Alastair Grey, completely destroying him, and he appeared before Aika yet again.

He walked forward towards Aika, staring at her, growling at her. And then, he lunged yet again towards her, but he passed through her, as if she was a ghost, falling into a large, dark pit. As he fell and fell, a massive red spear, that appeared to have wings on it, and that was seemingly thrown from underneath, flew up at him, and threw him out of the pit.

Before him, appeared a knight, holding a spear; much akin to the red spear that struck Atanti. Seemingly, they had 4 eyes, as they had 2 visors, and 4 arms, with one of them holding a spear. The knight towered over Atanti, as he tried to get back up, but the spear lodged inside him prevented it.

The knight stepped towards him with a clank, every footstep of their seemingly endless walk, Atanti could do nothing but stare up at them. As the knight reached Atanti, they dislodged the spear, and stood back up, their visor gleaming a bright red, and stared at Atanti.

With the spear dislodged, Atanti quickly regenerated; or, regenerated the best he could, Atanti grabbed onto the knight’s armour, and in doing so, he broke it, it broke easily, maybe even too easily. Atanti felt a slight shiver run down his spine as the knight’s armour fell to the ground of the Noösphere. Atanti could practically feel the knight smirking.

Below the knight's armour was slimmer, more form-fitting, armour. The knight now almost looked robotic, to a degree. And yet, despite only shedding their armour, the knight looked much taller. On their head was a thin, rectangular comb, possibly double the height of the knight’s head. And now, the knight had on a red flowing scarf.

While the knight still held the 2 spears they already had, in their other 2 hands, they held 2 much larger spears, which were pink and purple. These spears glowed, ever so slightly. 

[Who… are… you…]

Atanti growled, taking long breaths in between each word.

[I am the Holy Fourth.]

[The… Holy… Fourth… you…]

[Talk less, foul child of Aiv-Zon]

The knight, once again, struck Atanti with one of their spears, piercing his hide.

[This… this… this not OVER.]

[I’m impressed, for a foul beast such as you, surviving one of my spears…]

Atanti leapt backwards, trying to gain ground from the knight. As he did, he growled at them, still breathing heavily.

[Well, it matters not to me. I shall end this in one blow.]

Atanti jumped forward, possibly trying to break the knight’s armour again, but the knight just threw one of their spears inside Atanti’s gaping mouth, Atanti growled one last time, before the entire Noösphere turned quiet.

Breaking the dark silence, Aika clapped, walking towards the knight as she did so.

[Brilliant job…… Rakhi……]

[Ah~~ as expected, you already knew it was me.]

The knight- Rakmou-leusan, sat down on the ground of the Noösphere, taking her helmet off, as her pink hair flowed down her robotic armour, which considerably shrunk as she took her helmet off.

[How much of this was within your expectations?]

[Hmm…… Well, pretty much none of it~~]

[…What a bald-faced lie.]

[What ever could you mean?]

Aika smirked at Rakmou-leusan’s comment, before sitting down herself.
`,
        13: `
A giant creature roared up at the sky, it had tree-bark-like skin and towered above the nearby planet, which seemingly terraformed itself to fit the creature’s image. Around the planet were thousands of little dragon-like beings, their skin was similar in appearance to the giant creature.

Then, all of a sudden, thousands of osteoderm-like protrusions burst out of the soil, destroying any trees, foliage, and buildings in its wake. The protrusions moved around in the soil, before emerging out of the ground, the creature these protrusions belonged to was a deep blue, with large fins on its body.

Then, all of a sudden, it dove back into the solid ground, as if it was water. The other creature with tree-bark-like skin roared, unsure of what had just happened. Before it could read, the ground beneath it destabilised, and it fell into a massive pit.

The blue creature leapt out of the ground again, this time, making landfall, its fins turning into something resembling legs. It roared down at the pit that it had just made. Multiple vines appeared, reforming the tree-bark creature at the surface, which stomped down on the ground, filling in the hole, and bringing up itself. Both of them fired a beam at hypersonic speeds, which the blue creature effortlessly swerved away from, before releasing a chilling breath down onto the ground, which froze the other two.

As the two creatures remained frozen, a person, in a yellow cloak, appeared from a dark portal in the sky, with intricate gold patterns surrounding it. They seemingly walked in the sky, defying all known laws of physics.

[Sister Ao; the mighty queen Aika hath sent me to aid thy strife against Al’kawkab.]

[Kogane… I comprehend I hath forestalled Al’kawkab the best I can for now… I shall need thy aid still.]

The blue creature- Ao- spoke, although it never moved its mouth; it was speaking telepathically.

Then, Kogane vanished, as 8 more similar portals appeared in the skies above, from each one, a shimmer golden head emerged, the necks were long, each head had thousands of hair strands, and beneath the hair appeared to be large gold plates, resembling rose thorns. Each head roared, and the roar resonated a bit, sounding even just a bit ethereal.

As the multiheaded giant creature; Kogane’s giant creature form, appeared, Ao roared, and a mass of black dust filled the world. The tree-bark-like creature; The two Al’kawkabs, finally re-emerged, melting the ice, and parts of the surrounding area. One of the Al’kawkabs fired yet another beam, but it was obstructed by the black dust, as, from the shadows of the black dust, various blue rings appeared, varying in size.

An instant after the rings appeared, a blazing fire burned both of the Al’kawkabs, which burned and melted their bodies. Inside the dust, Ao had shifted, they had become much more massive, and their body turned into a charcoal black, with some blue accents.

However, despite all this, one of the Al’kawkabs survived, reviving itself, before firing another beam. The beam was intercepted by one of Kogane's heads, whose body seemed to distort the gravity of the beam fired into the sky, never hitting Ao.

And, yet another portal emerged in the skies, with the 9th portal’s appearance causing Al’kawkab to float in the air. From these portals, thousands upon thousands of golden beams of light emerged, many of these struck at Al’kawkab, while others killed the other small creatures on the light beams.

Each time, the beam reduced Al’kawkab to dust, and yet, each time, Al’kawkab regenerated, it was as if nothing could kill it. The light beam soon stopped, and as the light beams stopped, Al’kawkab roared and fired a beam up at the portal. Despite all odds, the beam struck the portal and destroyed it.

All of a sudden, thousands upon thousands of heads of Kogane appeared, each firing a beam of lighting at Al’kawkab. Each roaring at the same time, the beams struck at Al’kawkab, destroying it, and the surrounding environment.

As Al’kawkab regenerated yet again, Ao ran and struck at Al’kawkab with their body, before using one of their arms to grab Al’kawkab's head. Growing in size, Ao fired a large beam down the throat of Al’kawkab, burning Al’kawkab’s head off.

As Al’kawkab’s body fell on the ground, Ao roared up at the sky, walking towards one of the heads of Kogane.

However, Al’kawkab’s heart was still beating, beating, and beating; almost beginning to regenerate. Al’kawkab continuously regenerated, and then burned again, before finally turning several thousand beams of light, and re-emerging once more.

All from the heart of Al’kawkab, thousands of beams fired up at the thousands of heads of Kogane. Surprised, Ao quickly turned, trying to potentially stop the attack of Al’kawkab, however, she was far too late. Each of the beams destroyed the thousands of heads of Kogane, leaving only 8 behind.
        `,
        14: 
`As the beams of light fired all around the world, a massive Ankh stopped the beams of light from appearing. A man dressed in pharaoh clothing walked upon the planet and walked towards a cliff overseeing the giant creatures.

[Thou art Wukong, art thou not? Wherefore dost thou present thyself as Sesostris, and not as Temujin or Alexander the Great?]

[Ah… about that, he’s one of the strongest people who gave their body up to me. Ah, right, I’ll have to help you deal with Al’kawkab.]

Wukong—Sesostris— snapped his fingers, and thousands of Ankhs fell on Al’kawkab, piercing their skin. As the Ankhs fell upon Al’kawkab, their body heated up, and coated Al’kawkab in metal. 

[Seriously? Does Al’kakwab just have plot armour?]

Maybe.

[[[…]]]

[Then, how the hell do we fight him?]

You’ll figure it out, just continue fighting.

[We’ll… figure it out, huh… fine.]

[We possess a multitude of assaults; surely, we shall discover one that prevails.]

And, continue the story.

Al’kawkab began to move, slowly, firing yet another beam at the group of three, but a massive Ankh appeared before them, blocking the beam, and reflecting it against Al’kawkab, which completely obliterated it.

[Wha— how?]

['Tis almost as if Al’kawkab’s proton beam be charged with might or some such force…]
Then, like all other times, Al’kawkab simply regenerated from all the damage dealt. Kogane would go in next, each of their eight heads flying down to the Al’kawkab, biting it one after the other, in doing so, the heads lifted Al’kawkab into the air.

In a sudden burst, Al’kawkab exploded into a massive cloud of smoke, however, the tendrils made out of Ao’s black dust protected the group. As the smoke cleared, only tree-bark-like fragments remained. 

[There is no way this fight is over that quickly… there has to be something going on, Ao, or Kogane, can you sense Al’kawkab anywhere?]

Both Ao and Kogane looked up at the sky and closed their eyes, they became one with the universe and one with existence, eyes grew out everywhere, and saw the stars that died in fives, and then, they opened their eyes yet again.

[We have discovered Al’kakwab… yet, I know not if we can reach his realm in time.]

[What do you mean, can’t you just use one of your portals?]

[Nay. It is unfeasible to reach such a place as that. It is a world within Aiv-Zon’s realm, he hath concealed it. To reach there, we must soar.]

Ao shifted forms and turned into a giant creature, similar in appearance to a Hatzegopteryx.While Kogane's portals all merged into one, his whole body appearing, with massive wings, and appearing like a dragon, with long necks, and 8 heads.

The three then began flying faster across the cosmos, with Ao causing the black dust to follow them into the empty cosmos. They would land on another planet, a salt pan.

[Ao, Kogane, where are we now!?]

[This is most peculiar... some force hath diverted us hither...]

[What? Who?]

[We know not for certain; as far as I ken, it is some strange wight. It seems like one of the Elder Gods from the Gloom Beneath!]

Stepping in from the darkness below, appeared a being with the body of a man, the tattered black wings of a demon, the head of a bull, and 3 eyes, he was as massive as both Ao and Kogane.

Holding his flaming sword in one hand, he continued walking towards the 3, who were blissfully unaware of his appearance, he was seemingly invisible to everyone. Well, other than Sesostris, though he did not show it.

(Moloch’s here huh… so that’s the Elder God that Kogane was talking about…)

As the being—Moloch— walked, entirely undetected, a massive Ankh lay above him, which now Moloch did not notice. As Moloch quickened his approach, the Ankh followed him, and as Moloch took a break to strike at the 3, the Ankh fell on him, cutting off his arm.

[Ah… you know, I was going for the head, not the arm.]

[Tch… insolent fool, how did you do this.]

At this point, both Ao and Kogane were surprised, since Sesostris was seemingly talking to someone, but no one was there. 

[Well, I attacked you, you may be invisible to us, but we’re practically invisible to you as well. You can only detect the Humes we let off, can’t you?]

[…]

Moloch stared at Sesostris, surprised he could so easily figure out his trick, but he wasn’t done just yet.

[Wha- he’s vanished from this universe? How?]

As Sesostris said that, a plethora of burning hot, fiery, sparks descended upon them.

[No… maybe he didn’t leave this universe, but… if that’s the case, where did he go?]

A flaming red sword slash hit Sesostris, cutting him in two. The other half fell to the ground.

[[Wukong!?]]

[Jeez… that’s a pain, go on, young man, to the afterlife yet again.]

Wukong himself reappeared, putting his hand out towards Sesostris; the body he had been using for just a bit. He raised his and to the sky, and the body of Sesostris vanished into glowing blue particles, floating up to the sky.

Grabbing his staff, Wukong spun it around, before striking a seemingly empty location, it seemed to hit something, but, only once, after hitting that thing once, it merely passed through the spot.

[He’s hiding himself in something, I just don’t know what, I can see glimpses of his form appearing and disappearing.]

[Canst thou perceive aught? Who… or what might it be?]

[Moloch, one of the generals of the Scarlet King.]

[Verily, this doth bode ill. We shall see if we can render thee assistance. Kogane, canst thou perchance discern where Moloch doth lie?]

[Mayhap. I must be wary, for it demands too much focus to do it all at once.]

[Alright, leave it to me, Ao, see what you can do right now!]

[I comprehend, entrust it to me.] 

Wukong looked around for a bit, before striking yet another seemingly empty spot, which struck something again, before that thing vanished from that place. 

[Ao! He’s gone up behind Kogane!]

Hearing this, Ao shifted her concentration to behind Kogane, letting out a flaming blue beam, which burned something, which fell to the ground, and slowly stood up.

[Annoying fools…]

Moloch’s body vanished again, this time striking Wukong, successfully. Wukong stumbled back a bit but regained his footing. He watched around, waiting for a moment to strike. Concentrating, he breathed in, sensing everything in the surroundings. As he did so, he found an abnormal area, it was dark, but invisible normally.

Waiting a bit, he struck that location with his staff, which hit something yet again, he could do at least this much, any more was in the realm of what Kogane would be doing. 

Then, Kogane woke up, his eyes gleaming a golden colour like his body. He roared for a bit before Moloch appeared yet again.

[Wha- what did you do…]

[I simply destroyed the tridekeract you had placed somewhere outside this breadth.]

[What!?]

Wukong, without hesitation, instantly flew up to the edge of the universe.

[Ruyi! Extend!]

Doing so his staff, Ruyi, extended, and expanded, dwarfing the planet, then, it crashed down on the planet. In a haze of chaos, 3 different versions of Ruyi existed at once, one went back in time, the other was present right now, and the third was outside the universe, shattering the Tree of Creation, and erasing the Infinite Shore from existence.

Thousands of dreams, confined within shells, all collided into one point, a dream thought up by no one, and everyone. Colliding into dreams within dreams, the archetypes of different stories emerged, and a complex node of existence emerged, thousands of them, they weren’t stories, but were. All of these anti-stories, antinarratives, all consumed the one single story that now existed. 

On a shore somewhere, at some time, a woman looked up and found the same calamity everywhere. At all times, upon the shore, she saw dreams, which themselves had dreams within them, and within them, and within them, and then, the dreams were all destroyed. 

She watched, her red and black dress flowing in the place without wind, as chaos took hold, her red eyes glimmered in the oceans below before she vanished into the waters.

[DATA LOST]`,
          15:
`In the waves of the starless seas, a goopy mass with three heads shifts forms again and again. It finally settles on a form, a black tattered robe, long legs, and two pincer-like horns.

The being, The Shattered One, walked across these waves, and into the horizon, where all the chaos unfolded. Its movements were robotic, and calculated, never a step without meaning. It saw the Tree of Creation that was being destroyed, however, it ignored it, as that was not its goal, that was the job of Genryū.

(A/N: Genryū, or “幻龍” sometimes read as “Maroboshi Ryū” means “Phantom Dragon”) 

The Shattered One reached a glass barrier, where it saw itself, or, another version of itself. Thousands of them even, all of these merged into one, a radiant moth-like being. It saw Ruyi, but it wasn’t in the present or past, nor was it destroying the Tree of Creation as a metaphysical construct. This Ruyi was reaching outside the boundaries of the story, becoming one of the most hyperreal things in existence.

The Moth, which could no longer be considered a shattered being, saw the dreams of everything. A shell of dreams of different beings, and even different authors. It saw the intersecting narrative planes, infinite planes in layer 1, and perpetually fewer planes above layer 1. Its perception superseded what could be possible. Grabbing Ruyi, the Moth completely dispelled it from existence.

From the Darkness Below, the Scarlet King watched as the Moth repaired the 4th wall, fixing all the messed up interconnectedness of the stories which merged into one. Jumping, the Scarlet King strikes at the Moth, who is struck down for a moment, before getting right back up; its eyes glowing, and the Scarlet King vanishes.

Back in his halls, the Scarlet King appears, his face filled with panic. A sensation he had never felt before. The scope of the war he had waged so long ago was finally getting to him. Sanna’s veil could only protect him for so long, and now he had to look for other ways to make himself invincible yet again.

[…It feels as if I transported myself into the future… what even happened then… it’s outside of all my calculations…]

A robed figure approaches him, the robe is dark, with green accents, and beneath it was a dress. The robe hid their face, as they walked up the steps to the throne at the very top.

[Ah… great Fourth Queen… why are you here?]

[Harak… What happened to Jeser?]

[Oh… he got into a fight with the Archangel Vasílissa… Although he failed, he gained valuable information about the opposing troops.]

[Vasílissa? She’s not an Archangel, she’s the Concept of Light incarnate.]

[What… I thought she was a simple maid of the Koru-teusa…]

[No, she’s not, she’s a concept of my calibre. I’m surprised Jeser even survived.]

[Well, it seems she let him go.]

[Hmph… as expected of her, she’s as soft as ever… whatever, if chance permits it, kill her.]

[I understand… is there anything you want to do with Al’kawkab?]

[What… you… fool! When did I give you permission to go after one of the children of Order!]

[But, great Queen… it was instrumental to making sure we could fend off the hordes of opposing Voruteuts.]

[Fine… as long as you don’t harm Alim.]

[… Of course.]

[Good, any more news?]

[No, my queen, that’s all the news that I have.]

[Alright. Oh, and where is Goran?]

[He’s been banished, my queen.]

[And, why is that?]

[Well… he violated the treaty of Thorns and Flesh.]

The robed female sighs, putting her hand on her head.

[He was a useful asset… Well, in the end, he was as stupid as the rest… What about Moloch?]

[He’s planning on fighting the two concepts of order most likely to fight Al’kawkab.]

[Make sure to tell him not to kill them… It’s not important whether they die, it’s safer to have them alive, we can bring them to our side.]

[Understood.]

[Good, you are dismissed.]

Harak, the Scarlet King, leaves the halls, despite having no mouth, he seemed like he was grinning.`,
          16: `
          [… Wukong…… I told you that you should control your strength……]
Aika appeared, and stared at Wukong with gleaming red eyes. A red aura surrounded her body.

[You know…… I thought destroying the Tree of Creation was the worst thing you’d done, but, apparently, I’m mistaken……. You’ve literally collapsed every story into a singularity…… trillions of intersecting narrative planes…… all in one single universe…… and you even managed to break the fourth wall, since apparently that wasn’t enough……]

[Stop acting as if you didn’t expect all of that.]

[Just because…… it was one of my predictions……. doesn’t make it any better……]

[Alright, I get it. I’ll do better next time.]

[Next… time… ? There better not be a next time!]

[Yeah, yeah, I get it.]

[Good…… now go actually fight Al’kawkab.]

[Shouldn't you at the very least give me important information!?]

[Hmm? Oh…… right…… Well, you're likely to encounter Jeser sooner or later over there. I'd bet you can deal with him, right?]

[Yeah, I can, but what about Al’kawkab?]

[Al’kawkab, huh…… you know about Prologue?]

[Yeah, that's Kuro's ability, right? The one where she decides the beginning of anything she desires.]

[Yeah, that's your hint.]

[How's that supposed to help!? Doesn’t Prologue have thousands of sub-abilities!?]

[You’ll figure it out…… I believe in you.]

[Alright… I’ll go meet up with Kogane and Ao again, in that case.]

Wukong left the dark void, walking out through a hole in reality, and emerging back at the empty universe where Kogane and Ao waited.
* * * * *
Some time after Aika and Rakmou-leusan had already beaten Atanti, they were both relaxing for a bit.

[Ai-tan, shouldn't you be going and helping in the prison break?]

[Maybe…… but I'll relax here for now…… there's something I'm waiting for……]

[Oh, what is it? Ah… right, Wukong is going to shatter the 4th wall isn't he?]

[……Yeah.]

[I'll send the Shattered One to help you, in that case.]

[You sure you don't need to transform it into Cyflawn?]

[The Shattered One will likely turn into Cyflawn by itself.]

[Yeah, you're right.]

From the horizon of the Noösphere, over 6000 wings stretched from east to west, as a single being was in the middle of it all. 

[Ai-tan, what's that…?]

[Ah, that's Mekhane, you know her, right?]

[Ehh? That's Sofia-chan? Why's she appearing here?]

[It looks like she became a concept by herself.]

[What… Like, I knew she was really smart, but being a concept by herself?]

[I'll go talk to her about it……]

[That's never a good thing, Ai-tan, what're you planning on doing?]

[Oh…… nothing much…… I'll just be “measuring her worth.”]

[Ai-tan, the last time you did that, thousands of multiverses just “stopped existing.”]

[Well…… that just means that they were worthless…… does it not?]

[You better not harm Sofia-chan, Aika.]

[Fine…… I won't……]

[Alright, I'll be watching you to make sure, Ai-tan.]

[I'm not a child……. I can listen to instructions when told……]

[Alright, alright, go and do your thing now.]

Aika vanished into the dark patches of the Noösphere, and appeared before the many-winged being; Sofia.

[Queen of Illusions… What is your purpose for being here?]

[Ah, well…… I have to ascertain whether or not you're a detriment to the Hytoth…… especially with that intellect of yours.]

[What I'm doing isn't something you need to worry about.]

[Now…… Why shouldn't I? You turned yourself into a concept…… by finding a loophole…… Who knows what you'll do with this power?]

[You're perfectly fine with Rak being a concept; what's the harm in me being one as well?]

[Rakhi was a Voruteut, so she could've become a concept with enough time, her protecting of the Hytoth only sped it up.]

[Oh, but haven't I been protecting the Hytoth as well? Especially before the Scarlet Fiend destroyed the First Hytoth. I've toned down on it since I've had to shatter myself.]

[Well…… I never said I'm rejecting you because of that…… it's just that I don't really like rule breakers…… it doesn't matter if you're protecting the Hytoth…… especially if you're causing disorder.]

[I'm not here for a battle, but it appears this conversation will lead nowhere otherwise.]

[Alright…… you're on.] 

Aika quickly moved behind Sofia, swiftly hitting her on the back.

(I saw every outcome there was… I was certain I could evade that attack… it's as if she's unbound by fate itself.)

[What……? Not going to counterattack?]

Aika stared at Sofia, with a smirk on her face, while she did so, her silver hair looked almost blue.

[You should learn to be patient.]

[I see…… so patience is what I lack? It's nice that the…… god of intelligence told me that.]

(There must be a trick to defeating her, especially now that I've become a concept. There’s something somewhere that tells me how to overcome her… Ah… whatever… I’ll just counterattack with anything while I split my consciousness.)

[Abyss of Tartarus, seep through the cosmos!]

Thousands of arms reached out from the voids of existence itself, each trying to reach Aika, who dodged it all without much worry.

(I expected that, but seriously? Not even the Abyss of Tartarus works!? Well, now I think I've exhausted all my options, no ability seems to be able to penetrate her defences, and speed. An energy wave? Nope, just a waste of time, she can dodge those plentifully. Physical abilities are impossible, no matter how strong you are, she's simply always faster, not as if I have the physical strength for that anyways. Reality warping? She'd just out-warp me, those lords of Alagadda, that damned king wouldn't stand a chance either.)

[How interesting of a move….. Let's see…… What was that chant I had to do? Ah, right……]

(What's she doing…?)

[Let the midnight bell toll, and the demon beast roar. Go forth, creature of destruction: Άποκάλυψις.]

(A/N; Άποκάλυψις, read “Ápocálupsis” means “Unveiling” or “Uncovering” in Ancient Greek)

A giant beast of nothingness formed beneath Sofia, its form larger than most of creation. Opening its maw, it consumed Sofia, who could do nothing but watch. Though, before she gave up on trying to survive, she appeared outside of the belly of the beast again.

[You know…… I have a deal with a friend of yours to keep you alive…… so, you're lucky she was looking out for you]

[You weren't going to kill me regardless of what Rak told you, were you?]

[Now…… where'd you get that conclusion from?]

[Ah, just a hunch.]`,
          17: `Walking up towards Aika and Sofia, was Rakmou-leusan, now with her armour completely off. 

[Sofia-chan, you're finally a concept, aren't you?]

[Yes. I now embody the concept of intelligence.]

[Ah… I always expected you'd become a concept of intelligence or something. Sofia-chan’s very intelligent, huh? Well, being a concept is an adjustment, so, as another person who was once like you, so, as your senior, I'll be helping you!!]

[Rak, you should first look at what is happening ahead of you..] 

Beyond the massive void, a tear in reality, as the Tree of Creation was destroyed, entirely by Ruyi Jingu Bang, as stories became corrupted.

[Eh??? Ai-tan, we’re outside the range of corruption, right?]

[Three…]

[2……]

[One…]

[Just as I thought……]

[The corruption isn’t progressing quickly enough to be close to us.]

[It’ll just stop…….]

[Two metres away from us.]

[Ai-tan… Sofia-chan, you’re totes in sync right now!]

[Oh…… are we now? Regardless…… I’ll go give Wukong an earful.]

Aika stepped into the corruption, and walked normally despite it. The corruption seemed to consume her, but she still went on.

[Sofia-chan, will Ai-tan be ok?]

[Scanning… affirmative.]

[Whoeh… what was that!?]

[Well, that’s my “artificial intelligence” feature activating. I’ve made my body do that to make things easier for myself.]

[Ah, I see… anyway, do you want to join us in saving Alim?]

[Alim…? Searching database for mentions of “Alim.” Found. I see… she’s the one taken by that Scarlet Fiend. Sure, I have nothing better to do.]

[Great!! Welcome to the party!]
* * * * *
Aika returned shortly after giving Wukong a talking to, while Rakmou-leusan was still talking to Sofia.

[Ah! Ai-tan, you’re back! You see, Sofia wants to join our party to save Alim and Al’kawkab!]

[I see…… The concept of wisdom and intelligence…… being on our side is very helpful……]

[As if, Queen of Illusions, are you not already smart enough?]

[2 heads are always better than 1.]

[I guess you’re right on that, two heads are better than one.]

Aika, Sofia, and Rakmou-leusan all headed into the void, now cleared of all corruption. 
* * * * *
Walking through the strange, and muddy corridors of a prison, was Ýli, who was still wearing his tattered dark cloak. The serpentine pattern upon it was the only colour in this dark environment.

Ýli would continue to walk through this place, each cell was full of different people. Because of him simply walking around the prison, he was attacked by a lot of these prisoners, who were barely kept by their cells. Each of them were beaten one after the other with one strike using his massive wolf's teeth club.

[Gah… it's the robed demon with wolf teeth! All of you, hide!]

[It seems like I already acquired a nickname in this place.]

The man who was telling the others to hid swiftly came at Ýli with brass knuckles on his fist. Using his hands, Ýli easily blocked the strike, the fist didn't even puncture the armour beneath his robe.

[Wha-]

Grabbing his arm, Ýli simply threw him onto the ground, and the man completely fainted. Ýli threw him to the side, like he was a rag doll played by someone who no longer cared for it. And then, as if nothing happened, he continued walking. 

[So… you're the one who's wrecking this place? I'll have you know that you're in MY domain now. Everything you've done so far doesn't matter compared to who I am.]

[Such arrogance.]

Using his wolf's teeth club, he struck the man, who, to Ýli's surprise, was almost unfazed by the attack. Choosing to counterattack using small needles, which he blows onto Ýli's face.

These needles are barely large, one could even breathe it in, and completely not notice. They all glimmered a gold colour, each of these thousand pieces all entered Ýli's body.

The small needles all grew in size inside his body, piercing his body, and almost breaking his armour, especially in the places which they grew out of. Thousands upon thousand of these needles grew out of his body, but they didn't really faze him. Ýli simply moved his arm, and all the needles shattered. 

[What the hell!? That was Gáe Bulg! I stole that from that hound of Chulainn! It should've been a sure-hit, sure-kill! Regardless, I am Cythraul Gwaywffyn, you won't win this battle!]

[I see, like I expected, it was Gáe Bulg.]

In his arm, a massive spear formed. Its appearance shimmered a deep gold. And then, Ýli broke it into several pieces, exactly the same as what Cythraul did against him, these pieces flew rapidly over to where Cythraul was, and entered his body.

Like with what happened to Ýli, thousands of needles pierced Cythraul, though, unlike Ýli, Cythraul could not survive the thousands of needles lodged within his body, and turned into an aquamarine dust.

[Demon of spears, huh? What an interesting fellow. Although, he's not even close to beating me. I'll have to return this spear to Cú Chulainn later.]`,
          18: `
          While Ýli was fighting through the different foes inside the dungeon-like maze of the prison, Lùth was facing a different challenge. She had been tasked with infiltrating the Scarlet King's palace. Of course, it wouldn't be too hard, she had done infiltration missions prior. But, she was no Montauk, Ellie, or Clef, so she had to think about how to go about infiltrating the palace.

There were thousands of corridors within the palace; a labyrinthine location. From what she had gathered, in the centre, would be the thing she really wanted to reach; the throne room of the Scarlet King. There were likely various tricks that'd prevent her from reaching this goal though, and, as such, she'd have to figure out how to navigate this entire location.

[Ah… jeez, Nefel-san, could you try to figure out where the hell these corridors lead to?]

[Sure…]

Nefel closed his eyes for a second, seeing everything in the area. When he saw everything, he encompassed everything; from the air in the area, to the stone, and the creatures that lay within. He calculated trillions upon trillions of different paths, and found the way to the end.

[Got it. I think I have a way to the end.]

[Nefel-san, what do you mean “you think”?]

[Well, I'm not entirely sure, there are gaps within the corridor that my powers can't reach. Likely something that exists as one of the antitheses of stories. Though they should be easy to destroy, as they’re only guarded by Psémas, those “beings designed to destroy worlds.”]

[Ah… like the Veil of Sanna?]

[Yeah. Because of the existence of these antitheses, I can't entirely see everything.]

[Ah… jeez! There's something gooey in the ground.]

Nefel stared at the black goop beneath Lùth's feet, his eyes gleaming a deep gold. Then, he tackled Lùth away from the strange goop. The hand of a corpse reached out, grabbing the leg of Nefel, which completely disintegrated it.

[Wh-what was that?]

[It's a portal to Alagadda, I think the Scarlet King and the Hanged King have been working together more lately.]

[Alagadda, huh? Why don't I go deal with this thing then.]

[You sure, Lùth, you're not the greatest at stealth.]

[Stealth? As if I need that!]

[Hahaha… you're really energetic, huh? Well, it should be fine.]

[Alright! I'll go beat up the Hanged King now!]

Lùth jumped into the portal, with Nefel just watching, despite his initial worry, he seemed confident she could do it, as for him, he thought about continuing on, and finding out what the thing Aika needed was.
* * * * *
After descending into the portal for a while, finally, Lùth emerged on the other side of the portal, into Alagadda. A massive city-state, with architecture similar to various European structures. In the city, the sky was orange, and all the gothic buildings were dark. 

Lùth took out a dark mask, as in the city of masks, you cannot be seen without one. The mask had several black thorns, and black flowers. It was eloquent, and beautiful, as it hid her face entirely. It accentuated her deep red eyes, and contrasted her pale skin as well.

Though, despite this, the people of Alagadda feared her. Her mask didn't help, the 7 vines, and 7 spines on each of them, the flower with 7 petals on each of the 7 layers. The telltale signs of a demon who consumed stories.

[Ah… that still scares off the people…]

Lùth was still walking around, staring at the grand structures, there were even masked children running around. One of the children playing around accidentally bumped into her, and the mother had eyes of fear. Though, much to her relief, all Lùth did was pat her child's head.

[Jeez… you really should be careful when playing around. Stay close to your parents, and don’t run into strangers again, okay?]

[A-ah… alright miss…]

The child ran back to his mother, who still looked at Lùth, completely surprised. Rumours spread around the place as fast as possible…

[Has the Demon of Sevens grown soft!?]

[No way, I can still feel her demonic aura!]

[But she spared a child!]

[What's so strange about that!?]

[Are you a fool! There is no way you haven't heard the legends of the Demon of Sevens! She's murdered an uncountable number of families! It didn't matter if there were only men, men and women, men, women, and children, or whatever! They would always be slaughtered.]

All of this talk spread through the city of Alagadda. And because of this, people stayed further away from the general location of Lùth.

[It really looks like I'm a big name here, it's been a while since I've done the things they're talking about.]

A person stepped into the frame, red hair, red eyes, and a white mask, the Mirthful Mask, hiding his true nature to the people. Walking despite the commotion, he finally met face-to-the-face with Lùth.

##Ah… Demon of Sevens, you're actually here? I heard the calls of my people. I didn't think you'd come to consume us.##

[Oh, thank the Hanged King! It's the Red Lord! He's here to protect us from the Demon of Sevens!]

One of the mothers of the children that were playing said, her voice filled with hope.

##You're very hated by our people, you know? So why are you the one to show your face into our lands.##

[What your people think of me doesn't really matter. But, since you’ve appeared here, I’m going to assume we’ll be fighting.]

##You're absolutely right. I'm the first of the lords who'll fight you. If you defeat me, you get one of the keys to the main palace.##

[Red Lord! You're not implying you'd lose, are you?]

##Of course not! I'd never lose to a filthy demon such as her.##

[So, to you… I'm a filthy demon, huh? Well, come on then, let's fight.]`,

          19: `
Lùth stared at the Red Lord, she could sense the smile on his face through his Mirthful mask. Lùth didn’t know much about Alagadda, or the residents of it, however, she did know that the Four Masked Lords were powerful reality warpers.

The Red Lord went first, he warped reality, and the gravity surrounding Lùth increased. The ground crumbled beneath her, and the people of Alagadda ran back into their homes, though they still watched from their windows.

Unfortunately for the Red Lord, Lùth was entirely unaffected by the increase in gravity, as hundreds of black vines grew around the Red lord, encompassing him in them. These thorns penetrated his skin, and almost broke his mask, but, in the last second, he freed himself of their grasp.

The Red Lord began secreting a dangerous acid, which melted through the remaining vines, and began to melt the ground. As a massive vine-whip came his way, the Red Lord stumbled backwards, before he regained his footing.

##This is bizarre of you, fighting normally, what happened to you consuming our entire reality, and us along with it.##

[Well~ you see~ I happen to have some personal business with the Hanged King. Can't have a chat with him if I do end up destroying his city.]

##So… you mean to say you’re going easy on Alagadda?##

[Oh, of course not. If I have to, I will tear down this city.]

##Well then, unfortunately for you, I can’t have my people dying.##

The Red Lord manifested a spear, and, in an instant, appeared before Lùth, stabbing her in the chest. Lùth’s body unravelled into a mess of vines and thorns, with a flower in the centre. The Red Lord looked around, as if to try to find her, but to no avail. She seemed to have vanished from the face of Alagadda.

Unbeknownst to him, several black widow spiders were crawling around the city. They were tiny, and unnoticeable. Though, he’d finally see them, and worked fast to secure the location.

##Gah… you and your stupid games! My puppets, go and kill all these spiders!##

As he said that, the people, including even the child that Lùth had saved prior, started coming out of the building en masse, they looked like zombies. Following the orders of the Red Lord, they all began to find the black widow spiders, and killed them, in various ways. 

Seizing the opportunity, Lùth appeared overhead, and struck the Red Lord with her now vine-like arms. In a moment of quick thinking, the Red Lord used his spear, and struck Lùth with it. Caught off guard, Lùth stumbled backwards, as more spiders rapidly arrived, in an instant, there were thousands of them. Some of these spiders crawled up and down Lùth’s body, and entered the hole made by the Red Lord’s spear.

The spiders began making webbing, and filled in the hole they were in, while the others began cocooning the puppet-people. The Red Lord watched in shock as the city started to become overrun with spiders. Some of these spiders tried to get close to him, but he stomped on them all, killing them.

The Red Lord threw his spear at Lùth, cutting off her arm, which, after the Red Lord created pools of corrosive blood, almost entirely melted. At this point, the Red Lord was certain that he had decisively cornered Lùth, regardless, there was this lingering sense of foreboding in the back of his mind.

The world turned black, as the spiders which roamed around all formed an impenetrable black mass surrounding Lùth. The instant a person tried to get close, the spiders appeared to devour them whole.

##Someone, put my spear on fire, I'll deal with these spiders myself!##

One of the zombified people ignited a flame on their hands, and approached the spear, lighting it on fire. Said fire, however, got out of control, and burnt up the zombie, consuming it in a deep orange flame.

The Red Lord, unfazed, threw his flaming spear at Lùth, the spiders stared at the spear, scrambling to escape, and survive. In doing so, they made an opening, and… the spear struck. The mass of spiders scrambled out, and the spear harmlessly fell to the ground, in a pile of ash.

##Hahaha…. hahahahAhAhAHAHAHAHA… it was really that easy!?##

…But no one spoke.

##That’s all you have, you’re the Consumer of Stories; the void that stared back! Yet, a mere flame extinguished you! Like you did all of those stories.##

The Red Lord sat down on the ground, sighing.`, 
          20:
`There was a legend about //Itheadair//, the consumer. They were born from nothingness, the //Neoinitheachd//, and there, they began eating stories whole. They acted unnatural, like a program coded to do so. There never seemed to be a rhyme or reason as to why they ate stories. After all, they were never really hungry. Every story would be consumed from the inside-out by Itheadair, thousands, trillions. And the gods to whom they prayed, or the people who were supposed to save them, all failed against the consumer.

Stories spread, and spread, about Itheadair, how no one could stop them. Trillions of stories fell, and fell; people stopped writing stories, stopped having dreams. Then, as soon as Itheadair appeared, they disappeared. Some believed that they had gone back into Neoinitheachd, others said they had changed their modus operandi, no one truly knew. 

What had actually happened was that Itheadair was that they had split their consciousness into 2. One was an algorithm, incapable of doing anything outside its programming. This algorithm was the one who would destroy stories; and it did it well. The algorithm, which took the name of Itheadair, existed in the higher dimensional narrative vector spaces orthogonal to the three, four, five, dimensional vector spaces of most universes. No one could perceive the narrative vector spaces, no one could interact with it. And thus, no one knew of the algorithm that’d take their lives, until it was too late.

However, the algorithm, unlike the consciousness it had split from, was not perfect. People could still remember the stories once they were gone, but they could never trace it back to Itheadair, most just thought it was an issue with their memory. Some were smart, and catalogued it as an anomaly, but, regardless, for most, Itheadair was dead.
* * * * *
There’s an incessant blizzard somewhere, in a story long forgotten. This story, now, only exists within the confines of this dream, this story, none have remembered it, and fragments of this story are lost to time. But, it tells a story of a universe that was never meant to deviate in the way that it did. Prior to this story’s existence, this cluster of universes were perfect, Itheadair had never once had to end these stories. That’s why the universe caught their eye, because it never deviated. When Itheadair saw this story, this deviated universe, for some reason, they gained a sentience similar to their other personality. It’s unknown how the story went beyond the last chapter. Regardless, we have the last chapter still here, although Itheadair had removed all mentions of those who caused the deviation, to the point where their information was incapable of being transmitted outside that universe.

Though there have existed infinite universes in this cluster before, and after the deviant universe, and another deviant universe has never, and will never exist again. This is why Itheadair was so interested in the existence of it, and despised the deviant universe when it popped up. They thought that they had finally found a multiverse that would never have a universe, in a universe cluster, that would deviate. And this anger was targeted at those who caused the greatest deviations.

The story followed the themes of betrayal, and hatred, the other universes in this cluster never did that. They were all of a peaceful world, no conflict. The reason Itheadair hated it so much was because of this. This story deviated, for reasons unknown, and thus, the beings within the story were annihilated. Once it was all done, Itheadair moved on, though still showing a vested interest in the cluster, with the disappointment of that deviant universe, that interest waned more and more each day they watched it. More, and more universes collapsed, all ruthlessly destroyed, the same as that one universe. It’s likely that this change occurred because of the existence of that universe. And during this time, thousands tried to kill Itheadair, but ideas can’t be killed. You can’t remove the idea of an anti-story from existence, unless you have a better idea.
* * * * *
In the meanwhile, the sentient form grew differently, it was able to interact with other beings, the concepts, though, not at the best time. As for the concepts, one of their own had gone missing, and they were unable to find her. It was unbelievable that a being as powerful as a concept could ever go missing, but, here they were. This sentient half, named … would sometimes use Itheadair to try to find this missing concept. Though she did not know who she even was. Despite this, she moved onwards, searching thousands upon thousands of universes, with no luck. It was improbable that she was just deleted, after all, she too was an idea, and ideas can’t die. So, searching and searching, … gave up, turning into a black serpent, coiling around the Tree of Creation in one last Hail Mary to find her, but to no avail.`,
      21:
`The stench of the ashes of Lùth lingered for some time, the Red Lord still sat upon the ground of Alagadda, sighed, relieved. Though he had lost many of his people, they were all replaceable, he was not, at least, that’s what he thought. He saw several spiders crawling about, he paid them no mind, without a leader to rally behind, they were about as useless as the people of Alagadda. Despite this, their crawling, and prodding really began to get on his nerves, as he began burning them with his flaming spear, he noticed something, the ashes of the spiders were oddly similar to the ashes of Lùth. And then, it clicked, the thing that had burned wasn't Lùth at all, it was all spiders. The Red Lord raced to the spot of her ashes, there it was, lying there, with all the spider corpses.

He should have been more careful, and that's his downfall. He looked up at the sky, and saw a black feathered serpent in the sky. It was Lùth, the serpent that once coiled around the Tree of Creation. The grave mistake that the Red Lord had made was thinking that he could kill an idea. As long as stories existed, the ideas of anti-stories would too. He could not have been in a worse situation right now. No people to aid him, and nothing could save him from this impending doom that he was about to face. Again, he hurled his spear up into the sky, trying his best to prolong his survival, but all that changed nothing. 

The least he knew was that Alagadda would be safe, but that wasn’t reassuring. He’d need the help of the Hanged King to even stand a chance against Lùth now. He had to get to the palace of the Hanged King, but could he do that? He pondered, before choosing to go find the other lords, but who could he go to? For now, it seemed as though he was safe, Lùth was stationary in the sky, and didn’t seem to be following him. He rushed to the palace of the Yellow Lord, the White Lord would be too far. Looking behind him, Lùth finally began to move, eloquently slithering in the sky. 

Then, all of a sudden, the Red Lord began getting pelted with thousands of black spheres, he tried his best to dodge them, but, still, some did end up hitting him. Stumbling a bit, he managed to continue onwards, as Lùth slowly crawled closer, and closer, the assault of black spheres never seemed to end. The Red Lord had to be most cautious, he could not miss anything going on in the surroundings. From the ground, hundreds of black vines came out of it, and he tried his best to avoid them all. As he continued running, and running, far into the distance, he saw the lands of the Yellow Lord, and raced towards it. As he thought he’d finally be safe, he missed one single black vine coming out of the ground, and tripped.

He stared up at Lùth, floating in the sky, watched on, staring at the Red Lord, patiently. He had no way to escape now, despite this, he scurried back, trying his hardest to live. Lùth never understood why beings were so scared of death, and why they’d try to run from it. For all she knew, death was a part of life. And here the Red Lord was, trying his hardest to run from his fate. Death comes for all, does he not know that? She thought, she used to just be a being with no purpose other than to destroy deviant stories. She was curious. What was the reason for his defiance of fate? This was practically the first time this thought ever came across her mind… so, she asked it.

[Red Lord, why do you, and others like you, try to escape your fate?]

The Red Lord was puzzled by this question, he thought for sure that he’d be dead the instant he tripped, but this surprised him. He stuttered in trying to answer, never once did he think he’d escape his fate. Never once did it cross his mind that he could change the thoughts of the being who has murdered so many ruthlessly.

##How should I put this… for us, those who are not ideas like you, we fear death. Death is inevitable, yes, but we don’t know when, and that is the reason we fear it.##

The Red Lord’s response was definitely not thought out well, he was still sure of his death after this. And as such, he dreaded it.

[Interesting… it seems that I don’t know as much about universes as I thought.]

Lùth simply stared at the Red Lord, watching what he’d do next. Meanwhile, the Red Lord, having answered her question, tried to scurry away, shuffling on the floor. 

##I may spare you if you serve me. How about that for a deal?##

The Red Lord looked surprised, he never thought that he’d ever be spared, thus he was very apprehensive to answer, but he chose to anyway.

##I-I understand, I shall.##

[Very well. Then I shall spare your friends, those other Masked Lords, as well.]`

                <p>Author: I got bored, so I included shitty power levels. Be happy I didn't say shit like "The woman is infinite layers into boundless, and can destroy omniverses with ease."</p>

            <h3>Author Notes</h3>
            <p>Welcome to the first chapter of this series! I hope the insane power of the characters didn't scare you. This series only exists because… this series was once revealed to me in a dream. It's bizarre, it's meant to be, but also cool. There are many SCP references, and, don't worry, they'll be explained in the future. Also, if you're confused about what happened at the start, good. Also, you can skip the afterword, not much happens here, it's just a relaxing break; filled with gag characters. And, who knows, you might see the personalities of characters already introduced expanded upon in these afterword chapters.</p>

            <p>This is a complicated chapter, Jeser finds out about his past, well, not really, but still. And then, we get to the last part, where we find that the Scarlet King was lying. I mean, if you read an inkling of SCP, you knew he was lying easily. As for Nefel, well, he's not a you'll learn about him soon; but you can probably guess he may not be evil, given the Scarlet King is a goddamn compulsive liar. As for anything more, Montauk is here, from SCP-231, he's a cool guy, maybe. This also takes place sometime after the Phantasmal Queen has left the salt pan, so, that's why she's somewhere else in this chapter.</p>
