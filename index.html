Amid a desolate salt pan, a shimmering golden cathedral stood. Inside it were several pillars, in the middle of them were pearls which glowed an eerie, faint, red, illuminating the otherwise dim cathedral. In the centre, a massive stained-glass illustration of a demon, with red eyes, alongside the demon’s other eyes, many hands, and a red robe. <br><br>
 
Then, outside the cathedral, a massive red staff with gold accents, an endlessly changing blue orb sat in the middle of it. This staff fell onto the surrounding salt pan. The staff easily destroyed the small planet, while also destroying ten pillars near a door to nowhere.<br><br>
 
The world collapsed, and the universe fed into one singular point, a singularity of every single story in existence. From the most well-known, most loved, to the least well-known, forgotten stories made by cavemen in the halcyon days of yore.<br><br>
 
<div class="divider-transition">

Across the sands of the Infinite Shore, the shore of universes outside the bounds of the story that will be told, slept a dragon.<br><br> 
 
It surrounded the shore. It surrounded the Tree of Creation.<br><br>
 
The dragon was dreaming in the depths of nothingness, Voru.<br><br>
 
The dragon was dreaming in the heights of the absolute void, Shinkū.<br><br>
 
The dragon was dreaming in the depths of a backwater planet, Earth.<br><br>
 
The dragon was dreaming in the depths of time itself.<br><br>
 
The dragon was dreaming the past, the past within the future, the future, the future within the past, the past within the past, the future within the future. The dragon dreamed of stories, stories within stories, stories that didn't exist, couldn't exist, shouldn't exist, stories that weren't written, stories that had been forgotten, stories reconstructed.<br><br>
 
Questions such as “What is the dragon? or ”Why does an extra-universal entity resemble a dragon?” may be asked. In truth, the “dragon” is not entirely a dragon. The dragon is a complex web of nodes that just happens to resemble a dragon. Maybe it was intentional, though the idea that the dragon only resembles a dragon is due to the mind being incapable of comprehending it as anything else is more compelling. The dragon was like a tree, whose branches, eyes, wings, whatever you choose to call them, they’re creatures conquered by it, these branches swirled around the vastness of Shinkū as the dragon slept. The branches were always shifting, no form suited them, no creature could define them. Some were vaguely humanoid, most were not.<br><br>
 
Then, the staff which was destroying the planet destroyed the Tree of Creation, the tree of trees, everything that existed in existence, peaceful worlds with powerful beings, organisations containing the anomalous, stories of eldritch horrors all coming down to take over worlds, a dreamer who dreamt their own universes. These were all nodes of the Tree… the branches of the Tree. The dragon's branches were first to notice the destruction of the Tree… The staff ended the concept of “beginning” for the Tree, the staff warped time to shatter the Tree when it was being planted.<br><br>
 
Some beings glared at the staff destroying the newly planted tree, though without much interest, for them, it was a past already over, a past gone and forgotten, it was the future yet to happen, the future that already happened, but there was no “present.” For these beings, “now” didn't exist.<br><br>
 
The Infinite Shore, too, began to shrink, the grains of sand which made it up were falling in on themselves, turning into a singularity, becoming a singular stream of universes colliding into each other. The entities there resembled deities of all different religions, those forgotten, and others…<br><br>
 
Back in the present, the future, the past, the past within the past, future within the past, the distinction doesn't matter, it's just a time, it was when the dragon awoke, it dreamt itself wakening, dreamt itself dreaming its wakening, no matter how high up you went, the dragon was always wakening, until, as if no time had passed, since there is no notion of "time” in this spaceless location, the dragon woke up from the countless dreams it had dreamt.<br><br>
 
The dragon watched the staff destroy the Tree, it saw the beings which cared not for the Tree's destruction, and then, the dragon appeared everywhen, and, ejected the staff from the tree, and shattered it, and its pieces fell to the depths of Voru.<br><br>

Back in the salt pan, a woman with a striking black robe with long sleeves, which hid her eyes, on the robe were ears resembling the ears of Anubis. Her robe had gold and purple accents, while she wore a dark purple and black dress beneath her robe, and chains dangling off it. Intangible, changing, shifting, the future became the present, the present became the past, and the past became the future, everything, at the woman, all of it intersected, much like the beings watching the destruction of the Tree of Creation being destroyed… nothing could be set in stone about her… her form appeared to be bubbling, the universe, the multiverse, space and time, were all mundane components of her being. For a second, it was like her bubbling form ruptured, but this “rupture” was yet another mundane component of her being. Even the dragon which fixed the Tree of Creation was yet another mundane component of her.<br><br>

[Hyen sö jeranai…… uu-edōik Wukong pelod sānj uulengik enkhrek Ruyi…… Jerda uugeleda īll… Neka jeranei keio. Keder zeynes polej bhuheo…… Neka gödoram jeramœi the.]<br><br>

I apologise, it appears some Ortothan has slipped through the cracks, humans, you readers can’t speak Ortothan. I’ll fix this error:<br><br>

[As expected…… Wukong destroyed the planet without controlling Ruyi’s strength…… I warned him…… yet now I must handle the clean-up. The main event lies in the future…… I’ll have to deal with this again.]<br><br>

The woman spoke in a high-pitched voice, there could be multiple explanations, but no voice naturally sounds like that… something akin to a voice changer would be a best fit for what came out of her mouth. The bubbling, at this point, had calmed down, the bubbling occurred because of the destruction of the Tree of Creation, as if she was the Tree itself.<br><br>

[Hume levels stable at three…… Narrative Dimension overload fixed back to normal…… and the Tree of Creation repaired…… Infinite Shore fixed…… This should mean that I fixed all the damage Wukong caused…… whether sent out of time or back in time…… Well…… it’s going to happen again in the future…… This is such a headache……]<br><br>

The woman sighs slightly, her magic circle dimming as well, before vanishing into thin air.<br><br>

Elsewhere within the salt pan, a strange creature, with tentacles for arms, stood. Its most distinguishable traits were its striking white body, contrasting its black arms. The creature had no facial features and a dark, yet vibrant flame on the right side of its body.<br><br>

[Ahahaha… a vermin is now on the lands of the King? How impudent. Especially after lord Jeser granted me power…]<br><br>

The creature spoke, every single word that he spoke oozed arrogance.<br><br>

[How surprising…… The Psémas remain as arrogant as ever.]<br><br>

The woman spoke about the creature— the Pséma, whose tendrils unravelled, slashing at the lady, who dodged, as her robe vanished, for a second, the world bubbled into nothingness, for a second, everything happened at once, for a second… Her appearance could be mistaken as a bisque doll, her wavy silver hair glimmered in the salt pan that surrounded her. Her outfit was gray, and form-fitting, with black accents, it appeared to be the outfit of an assassin, or something similar. The colour of her eyes was a light blue, though the colour changed intensity, and on her face, she had a white opera mask on, its intricate designs contrasted the plain colours it had, while multiple feathers were on its right side. Placed around her entire outfit were pouches, seemingly with no pattern as to where they were placed. She didn't look tall, but was tall, she didn't look short, but was short, to her, height didn't matter.<br><br>

[Well~~ if you want a fight~~ I can give that to you~~ just be prepared to lose~~]<br><br>

[Me? Lose? Do you think I’d ever lose to a fool such as you? You’re a clown, you know that?]<br><br>

[A clown~~? Maybe I am~~ well~~ if I’m a clown~~ what are you? The entire circus?]<br><br>

[Tch. Insolent girl~~ you should not speak like that to someone stronger.]<br><br>

[But~~ you’re not really stronger than me~~ now~~ are you~~? So why should I respect you~~?]<br><br>

[Say that when you win.]<br><br>

[Well~~ I’m ready whenever you are~~ let’s settle this~~]<br><br>

The woman took out a dagger from one of her pouches, and then, she flung it at the Pséma who tried to deflect it, but his tendrils were cut off.<br><br>

[Annoying rodent. Well, in any case, you’re foolish, none of your attacks will ever kill me, I’m immune to everything you’re capable of.]<br><br>

[Ah~~ you’re a stupid one~~ huh~~? Watch me kill you.]<br><br>

The Pséma was hit with many daggers. The daggers fell from many piano wires, which were seemingly set up by the woman.<br><br>

[Fucking clown! You and your little tricks.]<br><br>

The Pséma tries to dodge the dagger, while many more daggers fly in from all directions. As the Pséma finally touched base with the ground, the woman threw down her dagger.<br><br>

[What? Accepting your loss?]<br><br>

[Far from it~~ I’m claiming my victory.]<br><br>

[Wha-]<br><br>

In an instant, the Pséma is skewered by many spikes, and large black nails, that coalesced from the shadows of the Pséma and skewered him.<br><br>

    <h2>Afterword</h2>
    <p>By the way, if you expect complete seriousness in every part of this story, you should stop reading. As a side note, the afterword will always be some sort of gag.</p>
    <p>??? ??????: What… why is this story so serious!? And what's with the power levels? I know these characters are very powerful, but for Chapter 1, this is too much! We're not powerscaling here!</p>
    <p>Author: I got bored, so I included shitty power levels. Be happy I didn't say shit like "The woman is infinite layers into boundless, and can destroy omniverses with ease."</p>
    <p>??? ??????: That doesn't make it any better!</p>

    <h2>Author Notes</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the first chapter of this series! I hope the insane power of the characters didn't scare you. This series only exists because… this series was once revealed to me in a dream. It's bizarre, it's meant to be, but also cool. There are many SCP references, and, don't worry, they'll be explained in the future. Also, if you're confused about what happened at the start, good. Also, you can skip the afterword, not much happens here, it's just a relaxing break; filled with gag characters. And, who knows, you might see the personalities of characters already introduced expanded upon in these afterword chapters.</p>

  title: "The Prince of Many Faces",
  content: `After the Pséma was killed, the woman looked towards the horizon and spotted a figure, moving, and spying on her. Her robe reappeared, as ten golden daggers flew at the figure in the distance. However, the daggers were merely burned up in the flames covering the right side of the figure’s body; much like the Pséma before.<br><br>

[So you’re Jeser huh…… or…… to be more precise…… you’re Jeser under a false disguise.]<br><br>

[I’m surprised, you got that correct.]</span><br><br>

Jeser, in their feminine disguise, spoke with two overlapping voices—one male and one female. The male voice dominated as if it was the one taking control over the other voice.<br><br>

[I am the Queen of Information…… Of course I did.]<br><br>

[Queen of Information, you say? How droll. You barely know about yourself and consider yourself the “Queen of Information”?]<br><br>

[Knowing about…… myself is meaningless…… I have no reason to care. All I need is to know my enemies…… And…… it seems to me that Aiv-Zon’s personality…… is rubbing off on you……]<br><br>

[Wasn’t the saying “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles”?]<br><br>

[That…… refers only to battle capabilities…… not personal matters like one’s past……]<br><br>

[Fine then, have it your way. A polite conversation isn’t what I’m here for. Since you killed my subordinate, I have to fight you.]<br><br>

[Well…… that's fine, but…… you won't be killing me any time soon.]<br><br>

[We’ll see about that. If you’re the so-called “Queen of Information,” I doubt you’ll show me your true power, will you?]<br><br>

[Of course not…… It would be foolish……]<br><br>

[Well, that’s fine, I have surprises lined up for you too.]<br><br>

[Oh? Like…… say……. your regeneration snake four hundred metres southeast…… or your magic-infused air bubbles……?]<br><br>

[Tch. Well, I have to say, you’re good, but you don’t seem to know everything I have in store.]<br><br>

[Not even curious……. how I know? As well…… I know more than just that…… You practised throwing a ball…… likely a magic bomb. Its power is insufficient to harm me…… And you have a “Voruteut” as your host body…… perfect for this…… isn’t it?]<br><br>

[How… I made sure I had no spectators.]<br><br>

[As I said…… I am the Queen of Information… There’s no way I wouldn’t know everything about you]<br><br>

[W-well then, If you know so much, do you even know my past?]<<br><br>

There was no arrogance in Jeser’s voice, only a sombre feeling. They truly desired to know his past, it felt like he had tried over and over, again and again, failing time and time again.<br><br>

[That is…… not something I am obliged to tell you…… What I will say is that…… do not believe the words of Aiv-Zon as the pure truth…… maybe…… if you are able to change…… maybe…… just maybe…… I will tell you the truth.]<br><br>

[Fine, I’ll believe you. Once I beat you, I’ll extract all the information about my past from you.]<br><br>

[You can try…… But I don’t want to reveal too much. So…… Φανερός…… Ἀρχάγγελος.]<br><br>

(Author Note: Φανερός, Ἀρχάγγελος is read “Fanerós, Archángelos,” which is Ancient Greek for “Manifest, Archangel.”)<br><br>

Then, an angelic being appeared, clad in twenty wings with hundreds of eyes on each of them. A golden glow shone from her body, her skin was pale white, and her eyes were a gleaming golden hue. If there was one way to describe her, it’d be “Light.” The word light practically emanated from like, like, say, light.<br><br>

Instantly, a bright golden spear of light struck Jeser, as hundreds more appeared, each piercing Jeser’s skin.<br><br>

[Shit. This is not good……]<br><br>

Jeser was coughing, and wheezing, attempting to regain control of the fight. They could do nothing but watch as more beams of light surrounded him. However, in an instant, the beams were dispelled by an immense red aura.<br><br>

[Strange Power. Red Aura. Identified Origin. Scarlet Sinner.]<br><br>

The Archangel lady spoke in an odd, robotic tone. Her voice sent shivers down Jeser’s spine, despite being protected from the beams of light, they could do nothing but cower in fear.<br><br>

Before the Archangel could attack once more, a magic circle surrounded Jeser, still cowering in fear.<br><br>

[Escape? Interesting Choice. In The End, Action, Meaningless.]<br><br>

As the magic circle grew in intensity, the Archangel readied two glowing spears, and struck the magic circle, destroying it.<br><br>

[Di-didn’t that phantom bubble have several authors in it… and she quite easily shattered the magic circle and the connecting narrative… What is this monster.]<br><br>

In Jeser’s mind, a voice rang out, a deep, cruel voice, full of only hatred.<br><br>

(Jeser. I do not expect you to survive, I do not expect you to even come back without injury, however, I will tell you about your past if you return with some information.)<br><br>

Jeser thought for a moment, they needed to know their past, so they had to gain some bit of information.<br><br>

(My lord, the great Scarlet King, I accept your offer, I shall gather as much information as I can before escaping.)<br><br>

(Good. I expect your arrival soon.)<br><br>

[Królowa…… Go easy on him. I don’t need a child like him dead.]<br><br>

(A/N: Królowa is Polish for “Queen.”)<br><br>

[Processing Request… Understood.]<br><br>

Jeser stood before the archangel, Królowa, more determined than before. Their body rapidly healed from the prior grievous injuries.<br><br>

[I may not beat you at full power, but you sure as hell ain’t killing me, my Regeneration Snake can bring me back from reality erasure itself! And it’s locked behind an infinite barrier, something you can never cross, no matter how strong you are.]<br><br>

[Foolish, Watch.]<br><br>

Jeser felt a shiver run down their spine as Królowa spoke those words in a cruel, indifferent, inflectionless, intonationless, voice spoke to them. In a flash of light, the snake that was protected by an infinite barrier, and the surrounding salt pan was completely and utterly melted by a single beam. The idea of infinity soon became finite, and the idea of finity soon became infinite. The beam of light had been stopped, and been pushed back again and again, but it kept going, shattering past the barrier, making its “infinity” equate to nothing in comparison to what the beam of light was. <br><br>

[Hahaha… this is some insane power, but, this is also information… valuable information at that. I’ll see what more information I can gain here…]<br><br>

Dark, black, flames run up to Królowa and cover her, however, she easily dispels the fire, before pelting Jeser with more beams of light, which they barely dodge.<br><br>

[I’m not sure how much longer I can hold out here… So… I’ll call it quits, I’ll hand over the Voruteut body as well.]</span><br><br>

[Acknowledged. Under the orders of my queen, I will permit you  to leave.]<br><br>

Jeser was still shivering, despite her seemingly normal voice, something about her exuded an air of authority. “He has to leave”, “He can’t continue fighting, or else, he’s dead.” Those were the thoughts that ran through his head.<br><br>

* * * * * <br> <br>

In a burst of light, the flames on the Voruteut girl vanished, and presumably, Jeser with it. Królowa vanished back into the woman’s shadow, which now had glowing golden eyes, always watching.<br> <br>

The woman stopped the Voruteut girl from falling, as her form continued to bubble, as spacetime reached critical hazard, and the world collapsed, yet again, into a singularity. The destructive nature of the woman was, bit by bit, destroying every universe, and of course, this commentary. As the bubbling calmed down, space and time existed again, though several holes were in spacetime, this would’ve reflected in the body of the woman, but it did not, the “holes“ that existed in spacetime, despite having just formed, became a component of the woman, another mundane component.`
