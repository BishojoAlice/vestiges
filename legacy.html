There is nothing but thundering footsteps echoing across the dimly lit corridor as Melanie enters a desolate room. Blood pools in her hands, forming claws. As Melanie enters the middle, a colossal statue resembling a gargoyle that is almost destroyed is perched atop doorways. Melanie began creating rings around her fingers and the building. Due to sheer luck, this alerted two groups: one shadow group with 13 people, and the other with only one creature; The creature dashed toward the building, and the rings vanished. Melanie was flung to the ground by the vicious creature; a hand almost crushed her head. However, Melanie’s claws grabbed the creature’s arm and sliced it clean off. 

She manifested a sword that sliced its head off without a struggle. “An Exolothréfsoun Tous Theoús. Despite millennia of perfecting the method of creating multi-dimensional creatures, it doesn’t seem that they killed any gods at all.” She muttered, restoring the weathered shelter to where it would not collapse. 

13 people went to the building. They let themselves inside, and, despite the building being well lit up, none of their facial features could be seen. They were chatting about a war that may occur. “The attacks on Coelestis Terrae have been ramping up. There may be a point where they declare a full war on us.” One said, “If they do, we wouldn’t be prepared. Therefore, we should instead attack first. I know that this is a risky move and could lead to countless deaths on our front, considering their troops are training. However, we need to take that risk to preserve the cosmos.” Melanie countered. “I’m willing to follow through with this idea. However, what would our military size be for this war?” A small, clear female voice piped up. The military needed some bigger numbers. “Say, how about 3 octodecillion troops? What would they do?” A man suggested.

“They don’t have enough manpower to create a billion Exolothréfsoun Tous Theoús. So saying they could even create a decillion? That’s impossible for them to do.” Melanie said. “If that’s the case,” Melanie said. “I will take charge of the military.” Said another, once again, male. “If that is the case, I will gather the troops. What else would we need?” Melanie said. “I’d assume we need a tank, maybe if we wanted to bring an air force with Nuclear apparatuses. If you don’t have a normal air force, a battle is pointless. Said the man. They wrapped up the discussion as and as it started, and the thirteen left.

Melanie headed out of the building. There was nothing to bother Melanie outside. You could describe it as serene, however, as the tranquillity wouldn’t last too long, as another Exolothréfsoun Tous Theoús would arrive. This one was plated in gold. It lashed at Melanie with full force; she was ready to intercept it. However, she was incapable of dealing a blow with all of her magic attacks being reverted to her, this heavily damaged Melanie, to where she could not even stand up against it. She had an attack planned and did it now. The plan comprised multiple places where Melanie had bled. She used this to her fullest, creating a spike of blood to slice through the Exolothréfsoun Tous Theoús. This, however, wouldn’t work out in her favour. The creature, no matter how hard she tried, the Exolothréfsoun Tous Theoús would absorb all the blood, and in the end, Melanie was the one being attacked.

She was taken to the base of the Exolothréfsoun Tous Theoús, where she was guarded 24/7. Not knowing where she was, Melanie limped over to the wall to realise it was made of rock. This development helped her, allowing her to merge stone with her biomass, which would let her heal back to full strength. She used this to her fullest capability, creating multiple spikes and shredding through the bars and materialising her Katana. The Katana sliced through all the guards. Then, after hearing so much racket, the warden of the prison came to investigate. He attacked Melanie, who only threw rocks at him. 

“Ha, pathetic. Only these measly stones? I thought you were better than that, little lady.” He scoffed, not wanting to waste his breath. Melanie and the warden were in what seemed to be a classic standoff, their breath the only thing disturbing the surrounding air. “Ha, rocks? Do you think rocks are the only attack I can use? You surely are pathetically misinformed if you think something like that.” Melanie laughed loudly. Soon afterwards, the rocks hit their target with another rock coming towards the Warden. This rock, however, was different. It turned into a weird apparatus, which would glow in a neon green light. Before the apparatus was activated, Melanie said, “1 metre 0.05 seconds.” Soon afterwards, the Warden turned to stone and was subsequently sliced and the rock aged and eroded quickly. “How fun, considering they had a weapon to nullify petrification. I had to erode him. Now he can’t be revived, stuck in a stony prison. How ironic, the warden is the one in prison.”

“The Δ Exolothréfsoun Tous Theoús is still there? Well, I never thought I would have to use this, but here I am anyway.” Melanie muttered under her breath. Then Melanie conjured up more swords and sliced at the Δ and, instead of cutting off the Δ’s whole upper body, it created a rip in space-time and killed it before it was even a Δ variant. This caused the current Exolothréfsoun Tous Theoús to evaporate from reality. Afterwards, the war of Mores Eoruem Kuvant was set into motion. The beginning of the Mores Eoruem Kuvant was completed, however, the war was not quite done. “Excuse me, I would like to inform you that the war has concluded. Should we bring our troops back?” Said a leading commander of the RMMF, the name given for the Royal Multiversal Military Forces. “No, it would be unsafe as, while you think that this war ended, it hasn’t ended for aeons, and it wouldn’t have just ended with the death of a brutal dictator,” Melanie said. “I’m not sure I quite understand. What do you mean by “Hasn’t ended for aeons’’ didn’t it just start 2 months ago?” said the CRMMF, which stands for Commander of the RMMF. “Not quite. It started Aeons earlier, the name of the war Mores Eoruem Kuvant stands for “Death of Quantum'' which hasn’t occurred. This current war was just a side-show for the veritable war to come.” Melanie replied. “Understood,” the CRMMF said. “I will make multiple supply trains to go towards them.”`,

`In a dim corridor. Leaves rustle, and vines move even without wind, and moss on the wooden floorboards. A 10000-eyed creature awakens, its purple flames growing aggravated; its 10000 eyes focus on one speck in the cosmological background and it shifts in size, revealing that the speck was a universe. Then a crumbling wall lifts ‌the darkness, and a brilliant shine comes in. Someone, likely female, is seen with a black hole near her and dancing purple flames surrounding her.

A strange creature with horns is in the distance, noticing the massive aura coming from the building, and it laughs. “Finally.” It says, thin lips curling into a cruel grin. The person's eye changed to a dark red as if she knew ‌she might be attacked. She uses all she has to attack the mythical being. “My power… It is surging,” The creature said with a green flame. “Now then, Melanie, if you decide to play smart with me, I’ll remove every ounce of magic in your body. You should just surrender now. But if you don’t, well… I can show you death,” It said with an orb in its hand. Melanie, now with a Katana in her hand, said, “Like hell I would, I’ve died decillions of times. One more would mean nothing.” It flung her back like she was a pathetic child playing pretend with schoolmates. “Pathetic. It seems I was wrong to assume that you were a goddess with immeasurable strength. But you cannot defeat me,” It snarled, pulling her closer so it could make certain she understood what he was going to say next.

The creature decided this wasn’t enough, and the being carved into Melanie, harming her vital organs as if they were toys to be played with. Deciding now was as good a time as ever, Melanie ripped out one of her earrings and tossed it in the air, a large Venus flytrap formed out of the jewellery. The plant was half the size of the mountains surrounding it, even eating some of the majestic rocky forms to grow even larger.

During this heart-stopping spectacle, Melanie focused her magic on distracting the beast long enough while the being stared up in awe and fear at the plant. The Venus Fly Plant burst a flaming beam made of searing hot stone, shining brighter than all the stars in the galaxy, burning its hide and melting the bones until it flopped on the floor, presumed to be dead. However, the beast regenerated all of its harmed cells, and created more cells, causing it to grow.

The Blast damaged the Venus Fly Trap, which disintegrated into ash. Melanie followed this attack by conjuring up a Katana. However, the creature broke her neck and paralysed her. The echoes of cosmic footsteps became louder, and a creature appeared in the shadows, dwarfing mountains, which just looked like simple roadblocks. 

It fired a concentrated ray of plasma, obliterating the skull of the creature. However, the creature regenerated each time its internal structure melted, it also moved around the organs to not be damaged as much. Another beam fired, which the creature expected, and absorbed the beam this time. The beam turned into an electrical charge and fired. This damaged the giant creature. It regenerated as fast as it could, revived itself, and fired an electrical charge. The creature thought it could block it. The Creature realised too soon that this was an Electro-Magnetic Pulse, which would leave it incapable of exerting magic. The giant creature soon blinked out of existence. Melanie laughed. 

“You might be capable of destroying planets. However, I expected a lot more from them. However, you were so pathetic, incapable of withstanding EMP Bursts.“ She said.

She approached the large gargoyle perched atop many doorways. Melanie conjured up 3 more singularities. That brought everything into her hands, destroying the building. “This building… It was about time someone destroyed it. ” She said with a cruel look on her face.

Behind her, remnants of the creature attacked. Melanie conjured up a sword and swiped at the air, causing the surrounding air to look shattered. Which caused a fatal and extensive earthquake; creating a canyon 31000 kilometres long, slicing the remnants in half. The land, which is now a 31000-kilometre canyon, catapulted into space. Then, meteors hurtled down with the True Fires of Samadhi, destroying most land nearby. In a radius of 100km everything there should have died, however, something emerged from the nearby rubble. It looked vaguely human, but it was possible to tell that it wasn’t human‌.

The creature broke off the land and hit Melanie, who didn’t have time to react. Then multiple bursts of compressed air hit Melanie, severely damaging her spinal cord and snapping her neck. Her arms soon broke, bones jutted out of the elbows, and her entire lower jaw was misplaced, breaking it in half. However, this doesn’t stop her, and instead, she turns into Kali — A Hindu Warrior Goddess, subsequently hurling this new creature far away and regenerating herself. The blood that it sustained fell to the ground and created a clone. Kali had a smug grin as she knew exactly how to deal with him. “Ha, I am a child of Gaea, if you wanted to, you couldn’t defeat me. My blood clones me; I am truly immortal, as long as I touch the ground.” The clones said at the same time. Kali unleashes a dark aura, likely from the power of Melanie, which lifts the creature 10 metres up. Kali also jumps up now with a bronze plate in hand, she slices the creature and uses the plate to store all the blood, some blood, however, touches the floor. The clones fume because they were almost beaten that easily, they were supposed to be the strongest, not Melanie. The clones decide they should most likely keep their distance from her and fight from long range. Barely after they’ve reached a consensus, Kali attacks again, this time slicing them in half, and putting most of the blood on the plate, still, some blood runs on the ground.

The universe seems to be at a standstill; because it is at a standstill. The Frozen universe doesn’t react to anything, nothing can even move. During the fight, Kali breaks the stand still and moves while the creature cannot. She lifts them and slashes them, no blood touched the floor, they were frozen in place after all. The plate collects all the blood and time resumes. Chaos grabs hold, all events that occurred during the frozen time occur at once. And the creatures die in no time.“I have dealt with someone like you before, but something is off, someone more akin to Antaeus combined with Raktabīja, you are a child of Gaea like Antaeus. However, you can duplicate using blood like Raktabīja. Interesting…” Kali said. Kali then turned back into Melanie, who was still heavily damaged and had Ichor all over her. She collapsed and fainted soon after. Melanie woke up in a prison she was taken to. 

Melanie was still damaged, so she couldn’t do much. She had noticed she was up to a wall and assimilated the stone wall to regain power. Because of this, she became less human; she had horns with a body made ‌of a material resembling the stone walls. She was soon interrupted with screams and a thud as if a cudgel had hit someone on the head. Melanie, Realising who it was, breathed a sigh of relief. “Ah, Wukong, how neat.” She said to him. “It’s fairly easy to notice your aura from a different universe,” Wukong replied. The Warden returned, Wukong noticed this and raised his cudgel and whilst Melanie prepared, the cudgel struck with massive energy, while Melanie’s horns formed lightning that struck the crystal body of the Warden.`,
        3: 
`In a dim passageway, the passageway was very overgrown and decrepit. The building looked charred. The building then abruptly shattered when a giant red and gold-gilded staff came down, destroying a random door and many pillars. All the while, a creature with multiple eyes wakes up and gets angry; being similar in shape to an avian, and it had no legs. Its purple and green flames grew aggravated, and then, in a sudden flash, the entire area changed, looking the same as the dim passageway that was destroyed; the leaves rustled, and the tracheophytes moved on the wooden floorboards. The movement seemed to be slightly different, and it had no plausible marks of charring as if it was the building but at a different time. 

Someone, a female, was seen outside the building with a black hole near her, dancing purple flames surrounding her, and a brilliant light blue and purple magic circle above her gold and dark purple hair; her clothes with frills. At the same time, a strange creature with horns saw the huge aura emanating from the building. “Finally,” it says, thin lips curling into a cruel grin. The girl’s eye changed to a dark red as if she knew it might attack her. “My power…” the creature said as it contorted into a Draconian creature. “Yes, I can feel it surging.” It said, firing a magical beam. Then the girl created a Magic Circle with the help of some weird hands. “Ha! I foolishly thought you would be All-Powerful; Omnipotent, Melanie, yet here you are using a magic circle. Also, those things near you, Ha, this means you are weak. So, to make fighting easy for you, I will fight with one finger, but it seems this is overkill as well.” The Creature said, scoffing. “Ah, sorry, I got a bit too enthusiastic, so much so that I made a magic circle,” Melanie replied. 

“Do not try to fool me, Melanie. I saw the Hands of Fate you used. “Those cannot be summoned by simply being too enthused.” The creature spat. The hands of fate started creating magic circles around a creature. “Woah there Pernicies deorum no need to spoil my name to them just yet, the hands aren’t even here to fight you, notice how they are not here,” Melanie scoffed while looking towards the viewer. Then the giant creature made some magic circles near its mouth and created a giant blast. “HOW DARE YOU TRY TO DECEIVE ME. I AM A SUPREME BEING” Pernicies deorum replied as it turned back into its original form “Vermin like you deserve to be exterminated” the being con31,000-kilometre Melanie off the ground, but, soon afterwards, a gigantic beam blasted it. “NO, I CANNOT FAIL, NOT TO YOU,” it said as it melted into atoms.

Melanie sighed as she used magic to grow the black hole that was near her. “How sad, the blast charred the entire hallway. I could not destroy the whole thing,” Melanie sighed, a small smirk clear in her voice. She walked into the blackened hallway, as the black hole grew in size, so it would engulf the entire building. Behind her, remnants of the creature attacked. Melanie conjured up a sword and swiped at the air, causing the surrounding air to look shattered. Which caused a fatal and extensive earthquake; creating a canyon, 31000 kilometres long, slicing the remnants in half. The land, which is now a 31,000-kilometre canyon, catapulted into space. 

Then, meteors hurtled down with the True Fires of Samadhi; a vibrant blue fire, destroying most of the land nearby. In a radius of 100 km, anything that remained there should have died, however, something emerged from the nearby rubble. It looked vaguely human, but it was possible to tell that it was not human. The creature broke off the land and hit Melanie, who did not have time to react. Then multiple bursts of compressed air hit Melanie, severely damaging her spinal cord and snapping her neck. Her arms soon broke, bones jutted out of her elbows, and her entire lower jaw was misplaced, breaking it in half. However, this does not stop her, and instead, she turned into Kali — A Hindu Warrior Goddess, subsequently hurling this new creature far away and regenerating herself. The blood that it sustained fell to the ground and created a clone. Kali had a smug grin as she knew exactly how to deal with him.

“Ha, I am a child of Gaea, even if you wanted to, you could not defeat me. My blood also clones me; as well, because I am a child of Gaea; I am truly immortal, as long as I touch the ground.” The clones said at the same time. Kali unleashes a dark aura, from the power of Melanie, which lifts the creature 10 metres up. Kali also jumps up now with a bronze plate in hand, she slices the creature and uses the plate to store all the blood, however, some blood touches the floor. The clones fume because they were almost beaten that easily, they were supposed to be the strongest, not Kali. The clones decide they should most likely keep their distance from her and fight from long range. 

Barely after the clones meet a consensus, Kali comes rushing toward them with her scimitar in hand. “So what if your power lets you be immortal as long as you are on the ground? I had forgotten this fact before, but we are not on earth now, are we? Your mother couldn’t save you, nor deal with me at full power, all I have to do is dispatch you so that you cannot clone anymore, Am I correct?” Kali said, laughing. “But I want to end this a bit quicker, so I will channel a power that you cannot escape from,” Kali said, smirking. A pulsating red aura surrounded her hand, and then, as the aura touched the creature, it vanished as if he had not even existed.

“I have dealt with someone like you before, but something is off, someone more akin to Antaeus combined with Raktabīja, yet you are a child of Gaea like Antaeus. However, you can duplicate using blood like Raktabīja. Interesting…” Kali said. Kali then turned back into Melanie, who was still heavily damaged and had Ichor all over her. She collapsed and fainted soon after. Melanie woke up in the prison she was taken to. While she could easily escape, she was still damaged, so she couldn’t do much. She had noticed she was up to a wall and assimilated the stone wall to regain power. Because of this, she became less human; she had horns with a body made ‌of a material resembling the stone walls. She was soon interrupted with screams and a thud as if a cudgel had hit someone on the head. Melanie, Realising who it was, breathed a sigh of relief. 

“Ah, Wukong, how convenient.” She said to him, “It is fairly easy to notice your aura from a different universe, though it was fainter than usual.” Wukong replied. The Warden was quickly approaching to inspect the situation. Wukong noticed a burst of energy from the halls and checked the hallway whilst Melanie prepared to attack. Then a cudgel struck with a massive force generating black and purple lighting, rendering any weak member of the prison unconscious. While Melanie’s horns formed lightning that struck the crystal body of the Warden, shattering the lower torso, this also shattered her shackles which held the true power of her aura. As the Warden looked at this new development, he felt as if something was grabbing his heart in all different periods in time and ripping it out. The warden collapsed with a gaping hole in his chest, however; he was able to shatter the magic circle; which was now red and purple, on Melanie’s head. Then Melanie teleported to the edge of the universe in a beam of golden light to where Wukong was, which frightened him, and because of this, he almost fell off his somersault. 

“Man, here I was thinking you were Guanyin. I was wondering what she was doing here of all places” Wukong exclaimed, still fairly shaken. “Considering that 2317 was taken care of, we should probably head out,” Melanie said with 1000 eyes and hands, one of her hands picking out a small universe that her eyes had found. “I feel like you're trying to remind me of Guanyin on purpose,” Wukong said. “It is not my fault that most gods have 1000 eyes and hands,” Melanie replied, enlarging the universe she had found, Melanie then dispersed her eyes and hands. When in the universe, she found the earth. “The sun looks redder as if it was a Red Giant. It doesn’t seem to be changing in size” Wukong said. “Oh yeah, and I forgot to mention this, but during your retelling of how you got into prison, how did those compressed air bullets even damage you?” Wukong continued. “Those were not regular compressed air bullets, they were infused with magic. Powerful magic at that.” 

“Oh yeah, the last time you were on earth Paraguay lost 90% of its population, we can’t let that happen again, the cover-up was insane as well,” Wukong said. “That was a while back, no need to mention it,” Melanie responded. They then started moving over to the Arabian Peninsula, between the Tigris-Euphrates river system. Both of them then descended into the area in a beam of golden light. “Uriel, how are you faring here? It seems one of the worst-case scenarios has happened, the anomaly “When day breaks” It might be better since 2317 has been taken care of already.” Melanie asked Uriel; a 30-metre tall humanoid creature that had multiple wings and a fiery body. “I am not doing too well, those vile creatures keep coming in droves. And about that thing about 2317, he should still be on earth, it seems he is attacking the foundation bases first.” Uriel said, as a human-coloured blob that had multiple eyes and mouths started approaching a circular range, it seemed that they just vanished at that 1-kilometre radius.

“You are telling me that the destruction of that planet did not kill 2317? I feel as though I put so much effort into nothing” Wukong groaned. “What sort of Buddha is impatient,” Melanie said, hitting Wukong with the blunt side of her Katana. However, this short-lived peace did not last too long as 2 massive pillars of human and animal flesh started approaching the 1-kilometre range, so large that even Uriel had to crane his neck just to see the top of the wall. Before Uriel could do anything, the impulsive Wukong turned into his 3-headed, 6-armed form to strike down the massive walls of flesh. Wukong resized Ruyi Jingu Bang into a staff that could pierce the heavens, and then Wukong started tearing up the flesh as his staff was falling on it. “Well, It seems he is handling those walls of flesh well, I guess I could just talk to Sefiros about the issues going on here. This might be bad, even more so if he is here as well.”`,
            4: 
`Melanie dashed off somewhere in a golden beam of light; the place where she went to had a giant tree; bearing fruits upon its branches. A being with horns and a mouth at its chest and 6 eyes on its head was tending to the trees. “Sefiros, do you have any idea what is happening on earth? The amount of chaos radiating from it?” Melanie asked Sefiros, “What do you mean, the tree of creation is not broken, not even any of the twigs,” Sefiros replied while looking at the tree. “That's strange? I was just on earth a few minutes ago; it was in chaos with ‘When Day Breaks’ and 2317 was causing chaos; and he; the ‘Scarlet King’, might awaken. It is your job, right?” Melanie asked. “Wait, take a look at the fruit of the universe; you can even see there is no chaos, nor a red tint that would happen with ‘When Day Breaks’. Strangely, you would have no reason to lie during the war, so it was unprecedented that this could even happen.” Sefiros said, “I guess I have some business on earth in that case, not even sure how Yahweh let this happen, including Uriel he should be fending off the beings.”

Melanie went back to the river system, where she picked up Sun Wukong. Just as he switched back to his original form after a long fight with 2 pillars, Melanie sent him out to protect the Tree of Creation. Then, unexpectedly, a weird deer with orbs floating around it suddenly appeared. “I could deal with the Scarlet King, but The Deer is another story, its nigh-omnipotence might be a bad thing,” Melanie said. “Considering it is nigh-omnipotent, how could The Sun affect The Deer?” Uriel asked. “I am assuming that it thought it had flesh, and because of that, was affected by The Sun. However, as you can guess not even The Sun could beat such a reality bender, it seems to be rejecting the sun after all,” Melanie replied. The Deer hurled its orbs towards Uriel and Melanie; they were moving past the speed of light. 

A cloaked figure; his cloak being gilded, had the same red aura Kali used to destroy the creature, appearing before Melanie could do anything. Then, it vanished, like the other time with Kali. The cloaked figure moved towards The Deer, ready to attack it. “No need,” Melanie said, with over 100 million magic circles in the sky. “You bought me enough time, for this ‘Exercitus albus’ the amount of energy to destroy those atoms was enough to hide it after all.” As she finished, the magic circles began firing multiple volleys of destructive balls of energy, seeming to avoid Uriel and the Gate he protected.

The ground surrounding the Gate had turned into a giant chasm, yet the sun still wanted to reach the other side; Eden. However, as they got to the floor, their skin started to look more burned than melted. The ground was composed of millions of uranium, which caused Severe radiation poisoning. Sefiros soon appeared, not caring about the destruction. “The chaos was there, not sure why it would not appear on earth’s fruit, it should not be like that” They; Sefiros said. “It is strange, but considering the accumulating power of The Scarlet King, the hidden chaos could have to do with him, this may be the first stage of his and their plan to destroy the Tree of Creation.” Melanie replied, “Melanie, was The Deer not stronger than it should have been? I remember in another canon that when I fought it the amount of energy The Deer emitted was much less than it did just now, there must be something happening.” Uriel asked Melanie.

“The Deer used to have relative Nigh-Omnipotence, now it seems to have absolute Nigh-Omnipotence, this may mean the Scarlet King could be more powerful than we imagined. Could this be them as well?” Melanie responded. “It could also be that they blocked the chaos on the Fruit of the Earth. Not just the Scarlet King, which would be troublesome for us,” Sefiros added, as he said that, a large tear occurred in the fabric of time-space, and just before blinking, everything was gone. 
'
“They have destroyed the Tree of Creation. I guess it was a good moment too, we have to make sure that the damage is not irreversible,” Melanie said, rushing back to where the tree was, however, it felt as if they were not even moving. Melanie realised this and recreated a basic form of space, allowing them to move. When they got to where the Tree of Creation had been, they saw Sun Wukong fighting a horde of purplish-metallic beings. The Tree of Creation was gone, with no traces of charring, it was as if the whole Tree had been deleted.`,
        5: 
`Sefiros watched where the Tree had been, the tree that it had taken care of, just gone with one rip in time-space by the one Sefiros despised the most, Qlippoth. Qlippoth wanted to return to what he enjoyed, which was vast nothingness before the Beginning. Light, Dark, Fast, Slow. Particles, Matter, Energy, Movement and Stillness, Quark, Baryon and Nonbaryon. Reaction and Resistance, or Planet and Void. Star and Singularity, Dust and Plasma. Life and Death, Plant and Animal, Bone and Flesh. Mind and Soul, Pain and Joy, Love and Hate, all the things that had made Creation; and Sefiros happy, were now gone. Melanie, in rage, that Qlippoth would even dare to destroy the Tree; put out her hand, and created her Katana again, her eyes glowing a blood-red; half her head seemingly having glitches. Melanie then cut at a seemingly arbitrary location, however, it turned out to be the flesh of a giant worm, which she missed, as if it was butter, its eyes seemingly frightened from the sight of the power Melanie exerted.

Then Melanie recreated the Tree of Creation in a flash. Her eyes returned to normal as she collapsed to the ground from overexertion. The metallic beings then tugged at Melanie’s soul, but Sefiros did not even let that happen, the metallic creatures engaged in a fierce but short battle with Sefiros, with none coming out on top. Sun Wukong cradled a severely weakened Melanie to the Gate and through to Eden, an aspect of Sefiros; The All Mighty, more commonly called Yahweh, greeted him and sent one of the angels to tend to Melanie.

“I cannot believe they broke through the Tree of Creation, especially with you there,” Yahweh said. “That is not the real problem; it was their core, but the thing is, something is severely wrong with their cores. No matter how many times I destroyed it, it kept on reappearing, they should have died after their core gets destroyed,” Wukong replied. “That certainly is strange, the destruction of a core should mean ultimate death, that was one of the laws of the universe if I recall correctly,” Yahweh said. “Wait, it’s a law of the universe, that is why they were acting so strange, the rules mean nothing anymore to Mendacium’s power, he is the Infinity of Untruths after all,” Wukong replied. “I see. Melanie’s real power was unleashed at the Tree, was it not?” Yahweh asked Wukong. “Yes, it was. However, considering it drains her energy that much, this would mean all aspects may need to be recombined to aid her,” Wukong answered. “True, but I am not ready to leave Eden behind yet. If they even get here, it is the end of us,” Yahweh said.

As Melanie woke up her magic circle obliterated, alerting Yahweh and Wukong to the massive black hole that did not spin; by all means, it broke the laws of physics, out of the black hole came trillions of hands, the same as the ones in the other universe. This time Melanie, Wukong, and Yahweh were prevented from touching the creature's leading body for long enough to form its body. Just as its head was about to be created, a giant scythe came out of nowhere and stopped the growth; it was Sefiros’ hand. Sefiros had finally returned; this time with the cloaked figure from before, which made the hands vanish; completely deleting its information. This gave Melanie enough time to completely recreate the magic circle, seeing how they could breach Eden, Yahweh told Uriel and the other angels to shut off the gate and defend Eden. Yahweh then recombined with Sefiros; becoming a figure; distinctively male, with long white robes, holding a white, blue and golden scythe in one hand, and staff in the other. His hair was white, his eyes golden, and he was as pale as a ghost.`,
        6: 
`The Combined Sefiros and Yahweh had no issue dealing with the black holes, however, despite Melanie’s best efforts, the black holes would not go away; as if they were permanent this time. Melanie tried many things; like changing the gravitational force to cancel out the black holes, but they just would not. Before long, Melanie’s body was deteriorating due to a major amount of energy use, Sefiros slashed with his scythe as much as he could, but nothing changed, there was no impact. The cloaked figure tried annihilating the black holes, but they persisted. By this point, Melanie’s body had deteriorated, leaving a mass of pure purple-coloured fire; like the being that was angered by something. The mass of pure fire started to glitch the universe it was in; It used the glitches to destroy the black holes, but they defied all logic, they were the opposite of Melanie; who was the infinity that is the truth, they were untruths generated by Mendacium’s powers. But, a thought came across Sefiros’ mind, he switched the universe that they were in, turning it into one where eternal black holes were the norm, and because of this he was able to destroy them as Mendacium’s power faltered. 

Melanie and the others breathed a sigh of relief, they couldn’t have such a freight happen again, as Mendacium would be more well-prepared. Melanie reformed a body similar to what she looked like in the stone, but it was purple and orange, but with wings which were orange. “Guess I cannot use my human body for a while; this will have to do,” Melanie said. The group travelled out of Eden. “Uriel and the others should be guarding the Gates of Eden, but we should warn them to still have some of them in Eden. Right, Veritas?” The Cloaked figure said. “Most definitely, we have to continue with the war by ourselves. So the angels guarding this area is perfect,” Melanie—Veritas— said. They came across many anomalies in this universe, but Sefiros was always quick to deal with them.`,
        7: `
They reached a giant inverted pyramid-like structure, made out of Ruby, topped with a lotus after they continued in a western direction. “Huh, Déjà vu,” Wukong said. “We are now at Mt. Meru, you should know this very well,” Veritas said. “Of course I do, I had to lift the mountain after all,” Wukong replied. “Anyway; what are we doing at Mt. Meru, it is strange for us just to switch universes so quickly.” The cloaked figure asked. “We were here to just stop by, But I can see some more Untruths; Psémas up ahead, so we will have to look out for them soon,” Veritas responded. The Psémas noticed their presence and stopped clawing at the mountain to fight their new enemy. They started forming multiple beams fired at the group; the Cloaked Figure destroyed them. They fired more beams, but this time the Cloaked Figure could not destroy the beams. “Move Apeiron; This is not a normal beam, it is a beam of Analítheia, it doesn’t seem there is any universe where this beam is the truth,” Veritas said.

Sefiros started to create a different universe, one where that untruth was the truth. Unfortunately, the Psémas took notice of this and fired a second beam of Analítheia, it proved severely fatal to Sefiros, who collapsed. However, their essence continued the creation of the new universe, no matter how hard the Psémas tried, they could not destroy the essence, the core just regenerated as they destroyed it. “That is eerily like the event that led to the Tree being destroyed,” Wukong said, slightly frightened. “Do not worry, I am the one doing it after all,” Veritas said, holding a purple shard with a red and gold design. “Hah, how did I not notice a Shard of Analítheia,” Wukong said. The Psémas were angered that Veritas had stolen their shard, and before Veritas could notice, they stole it back.  One of the Psémas grinned at their cleverness, while the other 2 attacked Veritas once more, again proving fatal, this time, they destroyed Veritas’ core as well.

Apeiron paused to think about what he should do next. Wukong also stood back, he noticed that they had increased their security on the shard. “Hah, I have a fantastic idea, Apeiron,” Wukong told Apeiron. “Let’s hear it then,” Apeiron replied, “Well, I just need a clone, then maybe I could pick the shard up. I would love to create a clone, but the Psémas might notice. It doesn’t seem they notice our chatter,” Wukong replied, Apeiron obliged and Wukong turned into a fly to steal the shard. When he reached the shard; he stole the shard and flew back to Apeiron before the Psémas could notice. Apeiron created a Bisento, easily 9 metres long. The Psémas sneered, presumably amused at the sight; they also created something, the Shard of Analítheia appeared, the real one this time.

Apeiron’s Bisento fell upon the 2 Psémas who were sneering because they already won. The Bisento took out one of them; its core did not reappear, and the Pséma was frightened about how they had taken the shard. Apeiron's cold gaze turned to the remaining Pséma, frightening it. The Pséma dodged out of the falling Bisento’s slash, which annihilated the surrounding stars. In a dash, the Pséma grabbed the shard it had thought was the counterfeit shard. It escaped the Bisento’s slash again, but it was more devastating, damaging the Pséma a bit. The Pséma fired a beam of Analítheia, which Apeiron tried dodging, but it curved, striking Apeiron from behind; Killing him. Wukong Attacked the Pséma with Ruyi, and the Pséma struck back, severely injuring one another. But it would seem that the Pséma would win because Wukong was on his last legs. Beyond all odds, Wukong did not fall, instead, he quickly came back, and went for a second strike. “Wow, that was one of my 72 lives, I think this fight will be fantastic,” Wukong scoffed, angering Pséma. The Pséma went back for a second strike, which Wukong dodged by turning into a falcon and struck the Pséma in the head with a powerful blow, talons coated with poison. The poison rang through the Pséma's body, paralysing it.
Wukong stole back the shard, only to find it blank with no design as it used to have; He realised that the Pséma had become the new shard. This would make it impossible to collect this shard, as if the Pséma could not be killed, they could not steal the shard back. Wukong stepped on the paralysed Pséma, shattering its core. “Hand the shard back, or else this pain will happen for all eternity,” Wukong said. “Isn’t that right, Clepta?”`,
        8: 
`3 Arrows came flying at the Pséma, which it tried dodging, however, the arrows turned into 3 playing cards. And struck the ground near the Pséma. The Pséma dodged as well as it could, only suffering minor injuries. The Pséma wondered who the person it was fighting was. Before it could come to a conclusion, 3 more arrows came in and also turned into Katanas. As the Katanas flew towards the Pséma, they grew and increased in momentum; as their mass and velocity grew exponentially. In just a split second, the Pséma dodged the attack. Then the Pséma created multiple clones, and made them invisible, the clones flew up to where the arrows were coming from. They flew for a while, yet they reached no area where the arrows could come from; as if the arrows had appeared out of thin air.
	
Then, the Psémas were shot down —The cards had appeared out of thin air— the main Pséma was frustrated that it got nowhere, if it could not locate where the Katanas were coming from, it could not counterattack. Then, all of a sudden, the Pséma was attacked by Wukong and sent flying. Ruyi grew until the universe looked like a speck in the distance. Before the Pséma could even react, Katanas came its way damaging it, but it was not dead yet, it could not die yet. With this much pain the Pséma wondered who this Melanie was, it seemed like a human name, but no way a human could best it and play with him as if it was a small rag doll. Then, multiple black holes appeared around the Pséma; The Pséma was being spaghettified by the black holes. All of a sudden, Multiple cards appeared out of the black holes. The Cards sliced and diced, yet did not kill the Pséma.

A man; wearing a suit and tie with a top hat with a blue stripe, and a cape that flowed when there was no wind, and that wore a monocle, appeared out of nowhere standing in the vastness of space. His clothes were entirely white, and as the Pséma started moving towards the man, he disappeared into the smoke. Then some cards appeared out of thin air, the cards moved with unbelievable accuracy. All of them hit the Pséma. The pain was unbearable; it felt as if it was not even a card that flew towards it. Then more cards fell upon the Pséma, and the pain increased drastically, increasing centillions of times in a split second. Then even more cards appeared, this time the pain increased by a factor of a googolplex. However, the next set of cards did not cause any pain to the Pséma.

The Pséma laughed, as it thought that with this, it had finally won the battle, in response, the man only smirked, as if he had anticipated that this would happen. He shot more poker cards, which of course, did not in any way affect it. The Pséma fired a beam, it looked red-hot, however, the man was not scared instead saying “Only 1 MeV/kB, how pathetic, not even half that creature’s temperature.” The man withstood the blast, shooting for cards, and the creature also shrugged that off. Then the man snapped his fingers, and the Pséma experienced pain that always increased by a factor of ℵ0, for the creature, the pain was unbearable, and even a slight movement caused major pain. After a while, the man vanished, and then reappeared with the Shard of Analítheia in his hand.`,
      9: 
`In a dim passageway, that was overgrown and decrepit, but also charred and molten in some areas. The building then abruptly shattered when a giant sapphire blue, imperial red and ==gold-gilded staff came down, also destroying a random door and many pillars. All the while, a creature with multiple eyes wakes up; being similar in shape to an avian. Its vivid violet and peach flames grew aggravated. Then, in a sudden flash, the entire area changed, looking the same as the destroyed dim passageway; the leaves rustled once more, and vines moved on wooden floorboards. This time, it had no plausible marks of charring as if it was the building but at a different time. 

Someone, a female, was outside the building with a black hole near her, dancing vivid violet and peach flames surrounding her, and a cornflower blue, lavender-floral and rose pink horn object on her black hair, that also had Savoy Blue in back portions. She wore a frilled shirt, and a black jacket, with a long skirt. Bangs covered her left eye, and her right eye had a black star, the star was thin and six-pointed. It glowed, despite not emanating any light. The star in her eyes soon died down to a white, contrasting with her ruby pupil.

At the same time, a strange creature with Rosso-Corsa horns saw the huge aura emanating from the building. 

“At last, yes, this is magnificent,” it says, thin lips curling into a cruel grin. 

“My power…” the creature said as it contorted into a Draconian creature. 

“I have achieved my most powerful point, for I am now a Yamata no Orochi!” Orochi exclaimed, from his body in the ground, along with its main head, came 7 more heads. 

The creature fired a beam at the girl, creating a sphere, and then a beam. The girl’s eye changed to a Radical-Red and the black pointed star grew outside her pupils' confines, as if emanating light, despite the absence of it, her hair turned into a blond, which shifted to a pinkish colour at the tips. More of the creature’s heads started to fire. 

The girl stood there, with a creepy stance and said, “Hmph, this will certainly be enjoyable. Let us see what you are capable of.” 

Her mouth deformed into a cruel grin which was just a black hole. No teeth, no tongue, just a hole. An array of 5 different magic circles formed, in colour they were the same as her hair. “

Well then, I seem to have overestimated you. I shall use one of my heads to make it easier for you,” Orochi said. 

The magic circles intercepted the massive blast and completely halted its progress. 

“Well, aren’t you so pathetic? But this may be very interesting,” the girl said. 

A sword appeared out of nowhere, and split in twain. 

The girl picked up the sword and said, “I guess this will do, but perhaps I can…” her voice trailed off as she held out the sword, a pink gem floated above the rest of the hilt, and a crown was on it. 

Before long, it transformed into a classic Japanese katana. 

“No matter how tough this… damned barrier is, I will break it!” Orochi exclaimed, seemingly out of breath. 

“This should be fine, for you have only me to fear,” the girl said, another cruel black hole of a grin spanning her face. 

All the heads congregated, and one of them said, “What would her next move be?” 

As they were saying that, a massive wave of energy reached them, slicing every head other than one, the one in the middle. 

“This has to be a lie, all of my heads, just gone?” Orochi questioned. 

As the girl said, “This is much less interesting than I ever could have anticipated.” 

The Orochi was angered by this and responded, “Despite all of my other heads being killed, I can still kill you, you vermin.” 

Its harsh words did not affect the girl much, just a face filled with a touch of concern for the creature, though more in pity than anything else. 

“You still… have the confidence to say something like that?” She questioned the creature. 

“How rude of you, just because you used Ժամանակի սուրը ծավալային բաժանիչ Աղետների հեռացում (Zhamanaki sury tsavalayin bazhanich Aghetneri heratsum)  you think you are powerful, and how easy you are to lift; as if you are vermin,” it said, as it lifted the girl, but soon dropping her, hoping for her to take some damage. 

A thin wire slashed through the bone of the creature’s hand. 

“Something like piano wire is very versatile, it’s thin, light, and almost invisible, due to this, it can damage severely,” the girl stated, her eyes flared up again though her hair was also cut short by the wire. “It also seems to have cut my hair as well.”

The creature responded in excruciating pain, “How dare you harm me, Melanie I will be sure to rid you from this plane of existence.”

“Finally you said my name. All that dialogue made my mind sputter. Well, I can end this fight now, in 3,” Melanie said. 

“Three what? Years? Centuries? Millennia? Aeons? I’ll let you know that we live much longer than that,'' Orochi said. 

“三”, (San or Three) Melanie said.

“二,”(Ni or Two) Melanie continued. 

“一,” (Ichi - One) She finished. 

“What is this feeling of impending doom?” Asked the Orochi, cracks forming on its body. 

The cracks formed into flaps of skin, becoming like a black gap in the interior. 

“What is this excruciating pain?” Yelled out the creature in immense frustration. 

“I thought that would last longer, pathetic, as I thought. At least the fight went on longer than the first iteration, at least in the drawn version,” Melanie said. “And the creature called this sword by the long name instead of just ‘Zhamanaki’, which is most definitely strange.” 

“Hmm, this is certainly interesting, why could the hallway have melted? However, this is quite sad, considering I cannot destroy this building myself. But could it be that the beam seeped through the magic circles,” Melanie said.
Behind her, the beam from the Orochi’s first attack continued seeping through, breaking the smaller magic circles in its path. Melanie formed a shield behind her. 

“How annoying that creature was, I could never have expected this,” Melanie said.

Cracks began to form in the surrounding air and caused a massive earthquake. Though seemingly impossible, a creature was in the destroyed ground, it has massive tendrils stretching out of the canyon. The creature looked human, he had silver hair and black armour, and his skin was pale white. He also has a cloak, and what appeared to be a Naginata, though it had a hole in the middle of it. He used the Naginata to create bubbles of air and Melanie gets hit with the bubbles of air. 

“Tsk, how pathetic, only one compressed air bubble took her down. Mendacium must have been overthinking,” The man said.

As Melanie lay dying; her spine broken, in a quick move, she turned into Kali; the Hindu Warrior Goddess, and quickly stood up.

“How annoying, he’s down the canyon I created,” Kali said.

“Melanie sure is surprisingly strong and resilient. She might be the most annoying rat yet,” The man said. “Either way, I would not like to lower myself to her level,”
The man noticed Kali jumping down the canyon and was very surprised.

“I’m the one lowering myself to your level, brat,” Kali said. “Either way, you damaged me when I was Melanie, so I commend you for your prowess, but let us see who truly is stronger,”

Kali stabbed the man, and her trident went through his armour, piercing through to the other side.

“Perhaps she is stronger than I anticipated, this could be fun,” the man said. “But if isn’t something, she not only pierced my armour but also through my entire body,”

The man swung his Naginata, creating a red slash of energy, which scratched Kali’s face.

“Congratulations, you just scratched me, and left a mark, however, unfortunately for you, your scar will be bigger,”

On the man’s neck was the same piano wire Melanie used to cut off Orochi’s hand. His neck was cut off, revealing a bunch of snakes that stood on the stump. From these snakes, his head reformed.

“Well, that certainly was fun, but now that I have shown my true capabilities, I say we finish this,” the man said.

“Snakes, what a wonderful revelation, I suppose that’s how you regenerate so fast,” Kali said.

“If you don’t already have ophidiophobia, then you’re about to have it,” the man said, a snake grabbing onto his body.

“Ophidiophobia, hmm, you say I will have it by the end of this battle, but I highly doubt that,” Kali said.
The snake moved toward Kali and wrapped itself around her. As the man used his Naginata to kill Kali, she only smirked in response

‘Notice,’ a robotic voice said. ‘Analysis complete. Initiating “checkmate” in 10 moves,’

‘Notice,’ the voice continued. ‘Switching to autopilot mode,’

‘Notice,’ the voice again continued. “Stopping the flow of time,”

Kali unravelled itself from the snake’s grasp and broke the Naginata.

‘Notice,’ the voice said. “Letting time flow again,”

The man was surprised, as Kali had just broken his Naginata. Though he was not surprised for long, as he used his snake, which had a weird ball in its mouth, and the snake wrapped itself around Kali again. Kali grabbed onto the snake, which let go of both her, and the ball, which she caught and threw back to the man.

The ball exploded, and the man tried to block the explosion.

‘Notice,’ the robotic voice said; though it came from Kali this time. ‘Opponent in check, initiating winning conditions,’

Soon enough, Kali turned back into Melanie, though she bore different clothes, a white dress, with a thin white scarf that was nigh-invisible, she had a necklace as well, but no horn. 

The man laughed and said, “You can’t kill me that easily,”

In the meantime, Melanie had created a bunch of knives, connected to wires, they were strung up around both the man and her.

“One wrong misstep, and I’m dead, that is what you’re thinking right? Because I cannot die before all of my atoms are eradicated,” the man said.

Melanie snapped her fingers.

A giant creature awoke, its head looked like a skull, and its jagged teeth lined its upper and lower jaws. Its piercing blue eyes illuminated the dark socket of its eyes. It fired a beam, terminating every so often.

Upon the man was a beam of light, terminating and even intervals, it was a dashed beam of light. 

“What is this odd light, it’s very bright. How strange,” the man said as he covered his eyes from getting hit with the light, though he couldn’t help but peek at the light.

The creature reformed the dashed beams into a complete beam, it fired down upon the confused man, and it melted his body, though parts of it were still intact.

‘Notice,’ the voice piped up again. ‘Checkmate complete, turning off “autopilot” mode,’

“Guess it’s exposition time since you are almost dead,” Melanie said. “So, to clear things up, you shouldn’t be able to regenerate, since the portions hit directly with the beam have been atomically removed,”

“Well, I wanted to kill you completely myself, for revenge of course, so this is completely within my calculations,” Melanie continued. “And to do that, I guess I should do THIS!”

A skeleton appeared from the ground, it had horns, and it had a light coming from its abdomen, the entire area was covered in the same red light. A beam came from the skeleton’s foramen magnum, originating from the bright light inside of it.

‘ATOMIC EXTERMINATION’ Melanie said, her mouth reforming into that black empty and cruel smile that she had previously.

The beam rained down upon the man. 

“Huh, I guess it’s strange for me to beat two enemies in the span of one chapter, this pace may be too fast,” Melanie said.

Although, afterwards, Melanie was drugged and put to sleep. Then, Melanie was in a room; it was cold, at least it felt as such. Melanie’s lips were blue, indicating that she may have hypothermia. Melanie soon woke up, shivering from the coldness of the room.

“Cold… How many days have I been here,” Melanie said, she took off her gloves to have a closer look at her condition, and as it turned out, even her nails started turning blue. “Hypothermia, so I assume it must have been around 2–3 days since I got knocked out,”

She put her bare hand on the icy cold wall, and her body was crystalline. Melanie stuck to the walls, where the iron bars of her prison did not reach. 
Soon, loud noises, like that of a cudgel hit a bunch of people. Melanie sighed a breath of relief.

“Ah, Wukong, how convenient.” She said to him.

“Of course, I’m here, your distress signal was pretty easy to notice, albeit faint,” Wukong replied. 

The Warden was quickly approaching to inspect the situation. Wukong noticed a burst of energy from the halls and checked the hallway whilst Melanie prepared to attack. Then a cudgel struck with a massive force generating black and purple lighting, rendering any weak member of the prison unconscious. While Melanie’s horns formed lightning that struck the crystal body of the Warden, shattering the lower torso, this also shattered her shackles which held the true power of her aura. As the Warden looked at this new development, he felt as if something was grabbing his heart in all different periods in time and ripping it out. The warden collapsed with a gaping hole in his chest, however; he was able to shatter Melanie’s horn; which was now red and purple, on Melanie’s head. Then Melanie teleported to the edge of the universe in a beam of golden light to where Wukong was, which frightened him, and because of this, he almost fell off his somersault. 

“Man, here I was thinking you were Guanyin. I was wondering what she was doing here of all places” Wukong exclaimed, still fairly shaken. 

“Considering that 2317 was taken care of, we should probably head out,” Melanie said with 1000 eyes and hands, one of her hands picking out a small universe that her eyes had found. 

“I feel like you're trying to remind me of Guanyin on purpose,” Wukong said. 

“It is not my fault that most gods have 1000 eyes and hands,” Melanie replied, enlarging the universe she had found, Melanie then dispersed her eyes and hands. 
When in the universe, she found the earth. 

“The sun looks redder as if it was a Red Giant. It doesn’t seem to be changing in size” Wukong said. 

“Oh yeah, and I forgot to mention this, but during your retelling of how you got into prison, how did those compressed air bullets even damage you?” 
Wukong continued. 

“Those were not regular compressed air bullets, they were infused with magic. Powerful magic at that.” Melanie said

“Oh yeah, the last time you were on earth Paraguay lost 90% of its population, we can’t let that happen again, the cover-up was insane because of it,” Wukong said after some time.

“That was a while back, no need to mention it,” Melanie responded. 

They then started moving over to the Arabian Peninsula, between the Tigris-Euphrates river system. Both of them then descended into the area in a beam of golden light. 

“Uriel, how are you faring here? It seems one of the worst-case scenarios has happened, the anomaly “When day breaks” It might be better since 2317 has been taken care of already.” Melanie asked Uriel; a 30-metre tall humanoid creature that had multiple wings and a fiery body. 

“I am not doing too well, those vile creatures keep coming in droves. And about that thing about 2317, he should still be on earth, it seems he is attacking the foundation bases first.” Uriel said, as a human-coloured blob that had multiple eyes and mouths started approaching a circular range, it seemed that they just vanished at that 1-kilometre radius.

“You are telling me that the destruction of that planet did not kill 2317? I feel as though I put so much effort into nothing” Wukong groaned. 

“What sort of Buddha is impatient,” Melanie said, hitting Wukong with the scabbard of her sword. 
However, this short-lived peace did not last too long as 2 massive pillars of human and animal flesh started approaching the 1-kilometre range, so large that even Uriel had to crane his neck just to see the top of the wall. Before Uriel could do anything, the impulsive Wukong turned into his 3-headed, 6-armed form to strike down the massive walls of flesh. Wukong resized Ruyi Jingu Bang into a staff that could pierce the heavens, and then Wukong started tearing up the flesh as his staff was falling on it. 

“Well, It seems he is handling those walls of flesh well, I guess I could just talk to Sefiros about the issues going on here. This might be bad, even more so if he is here as well.” Melanie said.`,
      10:
`Melanie dashed off somewhere in a golden beam of light; the place where she went to had a giant tree; bearing fruits upon its branches. A being with horns and a mouth at its chest and 6 eyes on its head was tending to the trees. 
“Sefiros, do you have any idea what is happening on Earth? The amount of chaos radiating from it?” Melanie asked Sefiros.
“What do you mean, the tree of creation is not broken, not even any of the twigs,” Sefiros replied while looking at the tree. 
“That's strange? I was just on earth a few minutes ago; it was in chaos with ‘When Day Breaks’ and 2317 was causing chaos; and he; the ‘Scarlet King’, might awaken. It is your job, right?” Melanie asked. 
“Wait first, have a look at the fruit of the universe; you can even see there is no chaos, nor a red tint that would happen with ‘When Day Breaks’. Strangely, you would have no reason to lie during the war, so it was unprecedented that this could even happen.” Sefiros said, “I guess I have some business on earth in that case, not even sure how Yahweh let this happen, including Uriel he should be fending off the beings.”
Melanie went back to the river system, where she picked up Sun Wukong. Just as he switched back to his original form after a long fight with 2 pillars, Melanie sent him out to protect the Tree of Creation. Then, unexpectedly, a weird deer with orbs floating around it suddenly appeared. 
“I could deal with the Scarlet King, but The Deer is another story, its nigh-omnipotence might be a bad thing,” Melanie said. “Considering it is nigh-omnipotent, how could The Sun affect The Deer?” Uriel asked. 
“I am assuming that it thought it had flesh, and because of that, was affected by The Sun. However, as you can guess not even The Sun could beat such a reality bender, it seems to be rejecting the sun after all,” Melanie replied. 
The Deer hurled its orbs towards Uriel and Melanie; they were moving past the speed of light.
A cloaked figure; his cloak being gilded, had the same red aura Kali used to destroy the creature, appearing before Melanie could do anything. Then, it vanished, like the other time with Kali. The cloaked figure moved towards The Deer, ready to attack it. “No need,” Melanie said, with over 100 million magic circles in the sky. “You bought me enough time for this ‘Exercitus albus’. The amount of energy to destroy those atoms was enough to hide it, after all.” As she finished, the magic circles began firing multiple volleys of destructive energy balls, seeming to avoid Uriel and the Gate he protected.
The ground surrounding the Gate had turned into a giant chasm, yet the sun still wanted to reach the other side; Eden. However, as they got to the floor, their skin started to look more burned than melted. The ground was composed of millions of uranium, which caused Severe radiation poisoning. Sefiros soon appeared, not caring about the destruction. 
“The chaos was there, not sure why it would not appear on earth’s fruit, it should not be like that," Sefiros said. 
“It is strange, but considering the accumulating power of The Scarlet King, the hidden chaos could have to do with him, this may be the first stage of his and their plan to destroy the Tree of Creation,” Melanie replied, 
“Melanie, was The Deer not stronger than it should have been? I remember in another canon that when I fought it the amount of energy The Deer emitted was much less than it did just now, there must be something happening.” Uriel asked Melanie.
“The Deer used to have relative Nigh-Omnipotence, now it seems to have absolute Nigh-Omnipotence, this may mean the Scarlet King could be more powerful than we imagined. Could this be them as well?” Melanie responded. 
“It could also be that they blocked the chaos on the Fruit of the Earth. Not just the Scarlet King, which would be troublesome for us,” Sefiros added, as he said that a large tear occurred in the fabric of time-space, and just before blinking, everything was gone. 
“They have destroyed the Tree of Creation. I guess it was a good moment too, we have to make sure that the damage is not irreversible,” Melanie said, rushing back to where the tree was, however, it felt as if they were not even moving. 
Melanie realised this and recreated a basic form of space, allowing them to move. When they got to where the Tree of Creation had been, they saw Sun Wukong fighting a horde of purplish-metallic beings. The Tree of Creation was gone, with no traces of charring, it was as if the whole Tree had been deleted.
Sefiros stood there, staring at the space where the Tree of Creation had been, the tree that he had tended to for aeons. The tree that had brought joy and meaning to his existence was now gone, ripped apart by Qlippoth's reckless actions. Qlippoth had always longed to return to the vast nothingness that existed before the beginning of everything. But in doing so, he had destroyed everything that made Creation worthwhile.
All the elements that made up Creation, from light to dark, from fast to slow, from particles to matter, from energy to movement, from quarks to baryons, and non-baryons, from planets to void, from stars to singularities, from dust to plasma, from life to death, from plants to animals, from bone to flesh, from mind to soul, from pain to joy, and from love to hate, were all gone. Sefiros was devastated.
Melanie, who had witnessed the destruction of the Tree of Creation, was filled with rage. She extended her hand and, using her powers, created Zhamanaki once more. Her eyes glowed an imperial red, and half of her head appeared to be glitching. Melanie then sliced at a seemingly arbitrary location, but it turned out to be the flesh of a giant worm. She cut through it like butter, its eyes filled with fear at the sight of the power Melanie exerted.
In a flash, Melanie recreated the Tree of Creation. But the exertion was too much for her, and she collapsed to the ground, severely weakened. The metallic beings that had been lurking in the shadows began to tug at Melanie's soul, but Sefiros did not allow that to happen. He engaged the metallic creatures in a fierce but short battle, with none coming out on top.
Sun Wukong, who had been watching the scene unfold, cradled the weakened Melanie and made his way to the gate that led to Eden, an aspect of Sefiros. The All Mighty, also known as Yahweh, greeted him and sent one of the angels to tend to Melanie.
“I cannot believe they broke through the Tree of Creation, especially with you there,” Yahweh said. 
“That is not the real problem; it was their core, but the thing is, something is severely wrong with their cores. No matter how many times I destroyed it, it kept on reappearing, they should have died after their core gets destroyed,” Wukong replied. 
“That certainly is strange, the destruction of a core should mean ultimate death, that was one of the laws of the universe if I recall correctly,” Yahweh said. 
“Wait, it’s a law of the universe, that is why they were acting so strange, the rules mean nothing anymore to Mendacium’s power, he is the Infinity of Untruths after all,” Wukong replied. 
“I see. Melanie’s real power was unleashed at the Tree, was it not?” Yahweh asked Wukong. 
“Yes, it was. However, considering it drains her energy that much, this would mean all aspects may need to be recombined to aid her,” Wukong answered.
“True, but I am not ready to leave Eden behind yet. If they even get here, it is the end of us,” Yahweh said.
As Melanie woke up her horn obliterated, alerting Yahweh and Wukong to the massive black hole that spun; by all means, it broke the laws of physics in that universe, out of the black hole came trillions of hands, the same as the ones in the other universe. This time Melanie, Wukong, and Yahweh were prevented from touching the creature's leading body for long enough to form its body. Just as its head was about to be created, a giant scythe came out of nowhere and stopped the growth; it was Sefiros’ hand. Sefiros had finally returned; this time with the cloaked figure from before, which made the hands vanish; completely deleting its information. This gave Melanie enough time to completely recreate the horn, seeing how they could breach Eden, Yahweh told Uriel and the other angels to shut off the gate and defend Eden. 
Yahweh then recombined with Sefiros; becoming a figure; distinctively male, with long white robes, holding a white, Majorelle Blue and golden scythe in one hand, and staff in the other. His hair was white, his eyes golden, and he was as pale as a ghost.
The Combined Sefiros and Yahweh had no issue dealing with the black holes, however, despite Melanie’s best efforts, the black holes would not go away; as if they were permanent this time. Melanie tried many things; like changing the gravitational force to cancel out the black holes, but they just would not. Before long, Melanie’s body was deteriorating due to a significant amount of energy use, Sefiros slashed with his scythe as much as he could, but nothing changed, there was no impact. The cloaked figure tried annihilating the black holes, but they persisted. By this point, Melanie’s body had deteriorated, leaving a mass of vivid violet-coloured fire; like the being angered by something. The mass of pure fire started to glitch the universe it was in; It used the glitches to destroy the black holes, but they defied all logic, they were the opposite of Melanie; who was the infinity that is the truth, they were untruths generated by Mendacium’s powers. But, a thought came across Sefiros’ mind, he switched the universe that they were in, turning it into one where eternal black holes were the norm, and because of this, he was able to destroy them as Mendacium’s power faltered. 
Melanie and the others breathed a sigh of relief, they couldn’t have such a freight happen again, as Mendacium would be more well-prepared. Melanie reformed a body similar to what she looked like in the stone, but it was red and black. 
“Guess I cannot use my human body for a while; this will have to do,” Melanie said. 
The group travelled out of Eden. 
“Uriel and the others should be guarding the Gates of Eden, but we should warn them to still have some of them in Eden. Right, Mirantibus U*?” The Cloaked figure said. 
“Most definitely, we have to continue with the war by ourselves. So the angels guarding this area is perfect,” Melanie—Mirantibus U*— said. 
They came across many anomalies in this universe, but Sefiros was always quick to deal with them.`
